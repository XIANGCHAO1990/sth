-TTL Linear Scale(50-1000mm)
1.Physical length is differnt from the travel length 50/100,150,200,250,300,350,400,450,500, 550,600,650,700,750,800,850,900,950,1000mm 5um.
2.High Precision linear scale
3.Resolution: 5um (0.005mm) 0.0002”
4.Signal: TTL square
5.Grating pitch: 0.02mm (50LP/min)
6.Accuracy: ±0.005 mm or 0.0002" (at 20 deg C)
7.Reference marks at interval of 50mm
8.Response Speed: 60m/min or 40ins/sec
Note: Buyers may choose any scale measuring length under 1000mm at this price.In fact,The scale can be made from 0-3000mm.Scale length above refers to the real travel of the linear scale. Actual physical length is 141mm longer than travel. One inch equuals to 25.4mm.

Features:
-The sliding part adopts the five-bearing system which has been proved to be the most reliable and durable. The main grating adopts 90-degree assembly, which is more accurate and accurate. -The repeatability of the measurement is more stable.
-The signal line adopts multi-layer isolation steel and metal soft shell protection, waterproof and anti-interference fine.
-Ruler body with aluminum die-casting, hard chrome plating, corrosion-resistant.
-Dust bar with special plastic, corrosion resistance, scratch resistance, friction resistance.
-Parts individual, installation, maintenance, easy maintenance, waterproof, dust-proof good, long service life.
-The sensor uses a glass precision metrology grating as the measurement reference.
-Multi-function, easy to operate, reliable and durable, so that the necessary processing of mechanical products.
