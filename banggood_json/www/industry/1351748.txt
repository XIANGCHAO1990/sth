   Main Features:   ● Industrial-grade master chip, 16 AD sampling accuracy, temperature, charging current,discharge current accurate real-time display, power generation at a glance.  ● Automatic focusing MPPT tracking charging, high charging efficiency, non-stop monitoringduring charging, bidirectional focusing tracking.  ● Large-screen LCD display, adjustable charging and discharging parameters. UItra-wide chargeand discharge adjustable, as long as you understand the characteristics of the battery set itscorresponding charging parameters, you can charge a battery. When the output is off, the timecan be adjusted, which is more convenient. (on the market, there is no point adjustment)  ● Acomplete three-phase charge management, effectively protect the battery, the battery is moredurable.  ● Built-in overheating, overcurrent short circuit, open circuit protection, reverse connectionprotection,when the fault is eliminated, the controller automatically recovers, does not damagethe device.  ● Bidirectional MoS tube anti-backflow circuit, high-power charging mode, ultra-low heat.  ● R5. 0 solar charging DC plug, R5. 0 DC lamp output DC plug, convenient connection.   SpecificationRated voltage: 12/24VRated current: 40/50/60/100AMax. PV voltage: 50VMax. PV input power: 750W(12V) / 1500W(24V)   Function 1. Always keep the battery on fill voltage condition.2. Prevent the battery from over-charging.3. Prevent the battery from over-discharging.4. Prevent the battery from reverse charging to solar panels during nights.5. Reverse Polarity Protection for Battery6. Reverse Polarity Protection for Solar Panels7. When the battery voltage is low, the controller will automatically cut off the load from the system. If the voltage of battery is back to normal and the load will restart working.8. Thunder protection9. According to the battery voltage grade, the controller can automatically set charge-off voltage, the load-off voltage, the load- restore voltage. (The parameter is default under 25℃ condition, locked by the CPU procedure, cannot adjust.)10. The controller will automatically compensate the temperature of the charging voltage according to the changes of ambient temperature.   Package Contents1 x Solar Panels Battery Charge Controller1 x User Manual (Clcik here for an online Manual)
