Description:FNIRSI-1014D is a two in one oscilloscope and signal generator, the real-time sampling rate is 1GSa / s and with 100MHz* 2 ana-log bandwidth, with 7inch TFT LCD display screen, the built-in high-voltage pro-tection module can tolerate up to 400V continuous voltage, without worrying about the oscilloscope burning accident caused by the probe not moving to 10x gear, built in DDS function signal generator and the industry's original chopping output (@ 2.5vpp), all signal frequency step is 1Hz, support 14 kinds of standard function signal and a customizable chopping signal, chopping The output device intercepts part or the whole part of the complex signals measured by the oscilloscope as the output signal of the signal generator, which can store up to 1000 customized cut-off signals. Come on and try it, it will not let you down.Features:Built in DDS signal generator, support 12 kinds of function signal.Capture output signal function, which can store up to 1000 capture signals.Targeted high intelligent decoding algorithm, the encoderlife is infinite, and intelligent anti-burn function, 1X Can withstand up to 400V withstand voltage.With 100MHz * 2 ana-log bandwidth and @ 1GSa/s sampling rate（1X = 5MHz, 10X = 100MHz).Fully fit 7 inch 800 * 480 resolution color TFT LCD display with bright colors and high contrast.High measurement voltage range: 1X can measure 0~40 V, 10X can measure 0~400V.Up to 12 parameters measurement：VPP，VP，Vmax，Vmin，Vavg，Vrms，Frequent，Duty+，Duty-，Time+，Time-，Period.Cursor measurement function: it is convenient to manually measure the period and frequency and voltage.Complete triggering function (single, normal, automatic), and at any time, the waveform display (STOP function) is frozen.Equipped with high efficiency One-button AUTO, and one-button waveform storage and screenshot function.Built-in 1GB storage space, can store up to 1000 screenshots + 1000 sets of waveform data.Powerful waveform picture manager supports thumbnail browsing, viewing, detailed viewing, page turning, deletion and waveform zooming in, zooming out, moving, etc.Equipped with a USB interface, which can be connected to a com-puter to share its screenshots with the com-puter, which is convenient for secondary analysis.Lissajous figures graphic display function can be used to determine the amplitude, frequency, and phase contrast of two groups of signals.FFT display function, can analyze the spectral characteristics of the signal, memory compression technology, waveform refresh screen does not flicker.With the screen brightness adjustment function and background gr-id brightness adjustment function, also easy to carry.Specifications:Material: ABSAna-log band width: 100MHz * 2Number of channels: 2 channelsMaximum real time sampling rate: 1GSa/sVertical sensitivity: 50 mV/div ~ 500 V/divHorizontal time base range: 50S/div ~ 10nS/divMaximum test voltage: 40 V (1X probe), 400 V (10X probe)Storage depth: 240KbitInput resistance: 1MΩADC precision: 8bitsCoupling mode: AC/Direct CurrentTrigger mode: Single, Normal, AutoTrigger edge: Rising edge/Falling edgeExternal trigger voltage 0~40 VExtension ports: USB picture exportPackage size: 340 * 140 * 70mm / 13.4 * 5.5 * 2.8inPackage weight: 2500g / 5.5lbPackage included:1 x FNIRSI-1014D Oscilloscope Host2 x Matching 100MHz Probe (1X and 10X）1 x Clip1 x USB Data Line1 x English User ManualDetails Pictures:
