BT-168D Universal AA/AAA/C/D/9V/1.5V LCD Display Battery Tester Button Cell Volt Checker


		Things seem to be running a bit slow? Still running slow after you replace the batteries?
		Why waste time inserting and removing battery after battery when you can just test it.
		Maybe it's not your batteries at all. With this tester, you can make sure of that.

		Test the voltage of AA, AAA, C, D, 9V, and even mini cell batteries. Voltage range on the back of the tester will help you determine the quality range of Good, Low Power, or Replace.
		Save some money on all those batteries you've been buying recently and now test them first! If they're still good, not only are you saving money on those batteries, you're also saving the environment by not throwing away something good.
		So be kind to your wallet and to nature and pick up this compact tester today! :)
