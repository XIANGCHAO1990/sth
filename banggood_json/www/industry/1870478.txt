Description:1. The M50 laser module can be installed on any engraver model of the Atomstack A5 series and can be used without any additional setup.2. If you own other brands of engravers such as Ortur, NEJE, Two-Trees, etc., you can also install our Atomstack M50 laser module, which comes with a free adapter in the box. Higher laser power, faster engraving speed! NEW ATOMSTACK M50 50W double ultra-fine compressed spot Laser Module: can be used for laser cutting machine, laser engraving machine, CNC, DIY laser. Upgraded high quality fixed-focus laser, no need to focus. Engraving speed is 200% higher than other 5W lasers.Specification:BrandAtomstackModelM50Optical Output Power9.5-10WProduct MaterialAluminum 6061 AnodeHousing Size44*52*50mmCircuit Board Size44*52mmCircuit Board12V/PWM Modulation BoardWire Rod22# 2P2.54 Terminal Reverse Wire 80mmOptical Lensφ6/glassFan12VLaser Beam ModeSpotWorking ModePulse WorkLightspot Size0.08*0.06mmWorking Time10000HWorking Temperature0℃~70℃Storage Temperature一40℃~85℃Sintering Temperature1000~1200℃Product Net Weight260gInstructionsClick HereItemsSymbolMinTypMaxUnitConditionOptical Output PowerPo9.510W12V PowerWorking CurrentIop/2.93.2AOperating VoltageVop/12/VLaser Wavelengthλp455460nmElectric PowerWl/34.838.4WFeatures:1. It can be used for laser cutting machine, laser engraving machine, CNC, DIY laser.2. Laser protective cover: The laser is equipped with a protective cover to protect the eyes of the user without the need to wear additional protective glasses. At the same time prevent pets from grabbing the laser spot.  3. Made of aluminum, strong and durable.4. Upgraded high quality fixed-focus laser, no need to focus.5. Aviation aluminum TTL driver board with cooling fan can ensure continuous long time work.6. Engravable materials: wood, bamboo, cardboard, plastic, leather, PCB board, aluminum oxide, non-reflective electroplating layer and lacquered metal.    7. Cutable material: cardboard, non-woven fabric, veneer, acrylic, some thin plastic board.8. 0.08*0.15mm double compression spot light coupling technology makes engraving more powerful and precise .9. Engraving speed is 200% higher than other 5W lasers.10. High energy can cut 8.5mm thickness plates at one time.11. The laser sintering temperature is 1100 degrees, the effect of engraving metal is better.12. The laser has a built-in horizontal gyroscope anti-tip protection device, and it stops working when the tilt angle is 20°.13. The wind-collecting hood can clean the dust to protect the lens to avoid laser energy attenuation.14. The transfer circuit board is compatible with 95% of laser engraving machines on the market，Including Atomstack, ortur, Neje, twotree, etc.CAUTIONS:1. The laser light emitted by the laser module is likely to injure persons'eye, so do not directly gaze its end surface and wear appropriate safety glasses to prevent laser light when it is working.2. Laser module needs an appropriate laser driver(PCB). When the laser module connects with power supply, please set the output voltage to zero.  The adjustment of the current should be slowly increased or decrease to avoid damaging the device.3. Keep the device working or storing in a dry environment. The anti-dust grade is over one million, in order to prevent dust inside the lens to affect the laser dot shape.4. Working at high temperatures will increase the threshold current, reduce conversion efficiency and speed up the aging of the device.5. When output power is higher than it's specific parameter of operation, it will accelerate the aging of the device.6. When the operation temperature of the laser diode is over 70degree, please do well heat dissipation of it.7. This laser module is an electrostatic sensitive device. Please make sure ground yourself or wear an antistatic wrist strap before you take it.8. 0.08*0.06mm double compression spot light coupling technology makes engraving more powerful and precise .9. Engraving speed is 200% higher than other 5W lasers.10. High energy can cut 8.5mm thickness plates at one time.11. The laser sintering temperature is 1200 ℃, the effect of engraving metal is better.12. The wind-collecting hood can clean and dust to protect the lens to avoid laser energy attenuation.13. The transfer circuit board is compatible with 95% of laser engraving machines on the market，Including Atomstack, Ortur, Neje, Twotree, etc.Package Included:1 x M50 Laser Module1 x PCB Circuit Board1 x Compatible Plate1 xFixed Focus Plate1xConnection Line1 xWrench6 x Screws1 x Power Supply
