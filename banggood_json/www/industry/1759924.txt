The set parameters run automatically, and the real-time monitoring well automatically cuts off the power according to the corresponding settings to protect your charging equipment in all aspects. From then on, your charging becomes more safe, interesting and playable!
1. FCOP: Full power Cut off (ON/OFF), you can set it yourself when the power is < 1W for 1 minute, it will power cut off
2. TC: Timed charging (ON/OFF), you can set the time period of 01:00-24:00 to charge regularly, when it reaches the setting, it will automatically power cut off
3. Overcurrent protection: you can set the range of 0.0A-5.1A by yourself
4. Over voltage protection: 01V-36V range can be set by yourself
5. Low voltage protection: 00V-35V range can be set by yourself360° rotating screen on all sides satisfies reading at any angleQualcom QC3.0/2.0 fast charge protocol trigger Automatic detection off multiple fast charging protocolsSupport PD fast chargeUD24 line resistance measurement function Support Android/Type-C cable resistance detectionAccording to the connection method shown below, first measure the current battery no-load voltage, and then add the output load. At this time, you can read the current battery internal resistance
The internal resistance calculation formula of this table: (no-load voltage-loaded voltage) / current current = battery internal resistanceUSB and Type-C Test Application RangeConnect and test various USB and Type-C interfaces and various battery devices
Multi-port design-multi-use and multi-playBattery power percentageThe meter can freely set the battery type according to the user in the background, the corresponding full voltage value and discharge voltage
If there is no low value, the system calculates the percentage according to the threshold set by the user, and then changes the color of the percentage through the battery symbol
Display (more than 30% green, less than 30% yellow, less than 10% red);
When the display range is between 1% and 100%, the POWER red light on the panel lights up, and the relay output interface outputs at this time
The level is used to control the relay to connect the current path. When it exceeds the range of 1%~100%, the red light goes out at the same time
The plug electric appliance outputs a low level to disconnect the current path to ensure the safety protection of the battery for charging and discharging.
People avoid the risk of damaging the battery due to overcharge and overdischarge, and it can also be used for other purposes of overvoltage and low voltage disconnect protection.Battery internal resistance detection functionAccording to the connection method shown below, first measure the current battery no-load voltage, and then add the output load. At this time, you can read the current battery internal resistance
