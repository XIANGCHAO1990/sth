Features :


	This products is designed based on market research needs of four in one tool, it combines together in one common tool (soldering station, hot air rework, and power supply for repairing mobile phones), there kind of function can be used independent switch or simultaneously, it occupies less area, practical and saves energy, and the product's performance still on going to further improvement.

	The products uses double-side fiberglass circuit board material, the components installation processes are performed orderly to ensure the clarity of electric signal floe.

	Soldering iron, hot air rework station and DC power supply are using independent dual-core micro-controller, which means they can work independently, when the problem occurs on one tool it does not affect the others. Dual-core CPU is used to avoid failures.

	Soldering iron hot air rework used for sensor closed loop circuit, micro-computer zero trigger-controlled temperatre, LED display. Larger power, temperature heating goes up quickly, temperature accuracy and stability, avoid to airflow impact, its really come ture lead-free soldering and desoldering. Machine's parts has self-detection devices, full-intelligent's over-temperature, short circuit, open circuit, overload etc. Failure of display and protection function.
