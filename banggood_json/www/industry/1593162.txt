Advantage 1: 

Vertical microscopes(G600) have an serious drawback : it is easy to lose sight of the details of the objects due to reflection.Because they are used in many applications such as solder on PCBs, model designation of some tiny chips and metals which requires distinct sight of the details of the objects. 

The G1200 specifically solve this issue.It is an angle-adjustable digital microscope that solves the problem of high reflection. It's a great experience in the electronics maintenance industry, and it's important to note that this machine has a large operable space than the others. It is very convenient to use tweezers, electric soldering iron and others under this microscope
