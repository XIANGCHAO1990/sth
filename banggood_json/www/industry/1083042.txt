1.8inch Colorful Display Multi-functional TFT Backlight Transistor Tester for Diode Triode Capacitor Resistor Transistor LCR ESR NPN PNP MOSFET 





Features:
	 

	It can be widely used to detect NPN and PNP transistor, capacitor, resistor, diode, triode, N-channel and P-channel MOSFET, IGBT, JFET, triac and battery etc.
	 It can also be used to detect infrared wave forms. 

	It also can detect zener diode and has the function of self-calibration.

	After detection, align the infrared remote control with the "IR" light, then press the button in the remote control, if the tester successfully decode it, it will display the data code and infrared wave form.

One button operation, automatically detect and shutdown, and you can press the multi-functional button to close the tester too.

	Put the pins of component in corresponding area, then dial the little handle and the tester will test it automatically, finally the results will display on the back light TFT screen clearly.

	Not like the usual black and white display, this tester will show results in color.
