Hello dear friends,


Here is the MUSTOOL team.

Last year, we launched a unique and excellent multimeter- MUSTOOL MT8206.

We've been thinking about how to Perfect the idea, that make a product with complete oscilloscope functions and complete multimeter functions.

After 1 year' research and development, Yesss!!! the MDS8207 is finally published!  


A high-tech intelligent meter!

A must-have tool for all electronics enthusiasts!

Descriptions:

	 

1. This handheld scopemeter is a portable tool for waveform measurement. In contrast with analog oscilloscope,desktop digital oscilloscope or digital multimeter. This multi-purpose station own 2 universal test instrument functions: Oscilloscope + Multimeter. 

2. It can quickly and accurately detect the faults of the circuit under test and can serve as an electronic engineers' assistant, is outgoing right-hand product for engineers, features are compactness, beautiful appearance and clear interfaces. 

3. It has three trigger modes: Auto, Normal and Single. You can lock and save the waveform of a non-periodic signal.

4. Its multimeter part uses a dedicated chip (6000-count), which can provide a higher precision.

5. It is no exaggeration to say that the MDS8207 is one of best 2 in 1 portable test tools(at this price) in outdoor research, production, debugging and repairing and will make you convenient in work!

		 
Functions:


1. 40MHz Bandwidth and 200MHz real time sampling rate oscilloscope

2. Multimeter and Oscilloscope Automatic measurement : Magic tool and essential for test newbie.
3. HD display screen, high-contrast display technology (white character on black background).
	4. DMM functions: true RMS, AC/DC voltage, AC/DC current, resistance, capacitance, frequency, duty cycle, diode/on-off test, transistor, temperature; maximum/minimum value displayed at the same time.
	5. DSO Trigger Mode: Auto/Normal/Single.
	6. DSO Automatic Measurement: VPP, Vmax, Vmin, Vavg, Vrms, Frequency.
	7. Manual shutdown or automatic shutdown is optional.

8. MDS8207 can store 100 sets of DMM data and 50 sets of DSO data.The storage location can be arbitrarily selected, so that users can store important waveforms in their desired location for viewing.

9. The measurement waveform signal is very fast. Just press the AUTO button to display a perfect waveform. The secondary display will display Vpp, Vaug, Vrms at the same time.No need to adjust the signal, period, amplitude first like a traditional oscilloscope

10.MDS8207 can directly measure high and low voltage signals, the highest measurement signal is 2400Vp-p, traditional oscilloscope can only measure low voltage signal up to 300Vp-p

11.MDS8207 can maintain waveform and analyze waveform
12. More new functions, waiting for you to discover...
