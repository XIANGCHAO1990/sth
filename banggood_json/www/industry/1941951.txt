Description:The pure sine wave inverter can drive any common equipment that can be connected to the mains, pure sine waveThe advantage of wave inverter is that the output waveform is good, the distortion is very low, and in fact the excellent pureA sine wave inverter provides a higher quality alternating current than the grid. Pure sine wave inverter pairThe interference of precision equipment is small, the noise is low, and the load adaptability is strong, which can meet all AC requirements.Load applications (including inductive loads such as refrigerators, air conditioners, lamps, etc.) without any interference(such as humming and noise) will not cause damage to the appliance.3000W is suitable for freezers, air conditioners, hand drills,Angle grinders, printers, washing machines, etc.3500W suitable for freezers, air conditioners, hand drills,Angle grinders, printers, washing machines,rice cooker, etc.4500W is suitable for freezers, air conditioners, electric kettles,Soymilk maker, induction cooker, etc.7000W suitable for welding machine, freezer, air conditioner,Induction cooker, microwave oven, power tools,water pump, etc.Application:#Blackout essential#Sudden power outage, you can use it to keep your home appliances poweredAvailable, appliances are functioning normally.1600W suitable for mobile phone charging, TV, computer,Fans, lights, etc.#Office must-have#Unit is powered off, you can use it to restore your computeruse, charge, etc.#Necessary for night market stalls#You can use it, there are lights for business.#Outdoor work essential#You can use it, impact drill, electric drill and other equipmentfor construction work#Security monitoring essential#You can use it to make monitoring work uninterrupted#Outdoor camping picnic essential#You can use it to cook instant noodles, cook rice,Night lighting, etc.Specification:Model kx-3500Type Solar InverterVoltage regulation rate 3 (%)Circuit topology full bridgeOutput voltage waveformPure sine waveSize 1600W -21*7*18cm 3000W-25*6*12cm 3500W-28*8*18cm 4500W-28*8*18cm 7000W-34*9*22cmType12V 1600W 24V 1600W 48V 1600W ,12V 3500W 24V 3500W 48V 3500W ,12V 4500W 24V 4500W 48V 4500W ,12V 7000W 24V 7000W 48V 7000W,24V 10000W 48V 10000W Continuous power800W,1750W,2250W,3500W,5000WOutput voltage220VInput voltage12/24/48VFrequency 50Hz / 60Hz If you want to buy product of 2200-7000W 60HZ, you can search ID:1823057.Safety Instructions for Use(1) Do not connect this device to a civil city wiring box, such as a home line.(2) Keep the inverter away from water, avoid water dripping on the machine or splashing on it, and do not insert or pull out the plug with wet hands.(3) Keep the inverter in a cool environment, the suitable temperature should be 10°C ~ 50°C, avoid direct sunlight and hot vents.(4) The inverter should be kept away from flammable substances or places where flammable gas is accumulated.(5) After long-term use, the inverter will heat up, so avoid close to heat-sensitive substances.(6) Ensure that the ventilation openings are smooth and the heat dissipation is good.(7) High voltage danger, please do not open the machine.(8) Use a suitable type of wire to prevent the wire from being blown due to excessive inverter current.(9) Make sure that the inverter is connected to the battery correctly, otherwise the fuse of the inverter will be blown. Turn off the switch when the machine is not in use.(10) Turn off the switch before cleaning and clean with a dry cloth. Do not use a damp cloth or detergent.Package Included:1XInverter
