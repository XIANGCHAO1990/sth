Features:


The battery internal resistance tester can measure internal resistance and voltage of the battery at the same time. The Kelvin four-wire test clamp is adapted in order to better avoid the influence of contact resistance and wire resistance, and more accurate measurement can be performed.

This product adopts intelligent control, liquid crystal display, and simultaneous insertion of Kalman filter mathematical algorithm, which has the advantages of high precision, high efficiency, low cost, light weight, energy saving and environmental protection. Built-in 1000mAh lithium battery, 5V charging, Android mobile phone charger can be used, which is very convenient.

This product is widely used in various battery production, maintenance, testing, scientific research laboratories and other occasions. It can also be used to measure AC resistance of capacitors and resistors with low resistance and high precision.
