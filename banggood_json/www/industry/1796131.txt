Description:FR2000+ series clamp-on ground resistance tester is a new generation of ground resistance tester carefully developed by our company's technical team. It uses a new generation of LCD black screen backlight display and microprocessor technology, Ω+A synchronous display, through induction The method of measuring grounding resistance is convenient and quick. When measuring a grounding system with loops, there is no need to disconnect the ground lead wire, no auxiliary electrode, and it is safe and fast. It is widely used in telecommunications, electric power, meteorology, computer rooms, oil fields, power distribution lines, tower transmission lines, gas stations, factory grounding grids, evade thunder rods, etc. The instrument has the characteristics of accurate, fast, simple, stable and reliable testing.The FR2000+ series clamp-on ground resistance tester is controlled by a microprocessor, which can accurately detect ground resistance and leakage current. It uses fast filtering technology to minimize interference. Store 300 sets of data at the same time.★Resistance range: 0-1200Ω★Current range: 0-20A★New black screen design, high-end luxury★Ω + A same screen display★Quick self-check function, no need to wait★Using fast filtering technology, strong anti-interference ability★New design, long life of clamp head★300 groups of storage Specification:Model: FR2000A+Resistance range: 0.01Ω-200ΩType: PracticalResistance resolution: 0.001ΩCurrent range: noneCurrent resolution: noneFunction: ground resistance test, loop resistance test, leakage current testAccuracy: Ground resistance accuracy: ±1%±0.01Ω, current accuracy: ±2%±1mAAmbient temperature and humidity: 23°C±5°C, below 75%rhPower supply: DC6V (4 AA alkaline dry batteries)Measurement method: mutual inductance methodJaw size: 55mm x 32mmΩ + A simultaneous display: Ω + A simultaneous displayDisplay mode: 4-digit LCD display, black screen designLCD size: 46mm x 29mmInstrument size: length, width and height: 285mm x 85mm x 58mmMeasuring time: 2 times/secData storage: 300 groups, "MEM" storage indication, display "FUL" symbol to indicate storage is fullData access: "MR" symbol indicates when accessing dataOverflow display: “OL” symbol indicates when over-range overflowInterference test: automatic identification of interference signals, "NOISE" symbol indicates when the interference current is largeAlarm function: when the measured value exceeds the alarm set value, an alarm will be issuedBattery voltage: real-time display of battery power, reminding to charge in time when the battery voltage is lowAutomatic shutdown: "APO" indication, automatic shutdown after 5 minutes of startupPower consumption: 50mA MaxQuality: Meter: 1180g (including battery)Working temperature and humidity: -10°C~40C; below 80%rhStorage temperature and humidity: -20°C~60C; below 70%rhInsulation resistance: above 20MΩ (500V between circuit and case)Withstand voltage: AC 3700V/rms (between circuit and case)External magnetic field: <40A/mExternal electric field: <1V/mSuitable for safety regulations: IEC61010-1 (CAT ll 300V, CAT IV 150V, pollution degree 2); IEC61010-031; IEC61557-1 (ground resistance).Package includes:1 x Meter1 x Calibration ring1 x Instrument package1 x User ManualDetails picture:
