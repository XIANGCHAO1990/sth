Features:DT71 Mini Digital Tweezers is a tool for multi-function measurements with full differential input measurement. DT71 has a unique trinary structure, which can be separated into the controller, testing arms, and tweezer tips, which are flexible to be replaced and combined.Innovative trinary structure: separated into the controller, testing arms, and tweezer tips, which are flexible to be replaced and combined.360° rotatable controller with OLED screen, with good viewing angles.Smart gesture recognition with automatic identification of left/right-hand operation and adjusting the screen orientation accordingly.Hidden touch button on top of the controller, which makes it easy to operate with only a light touch.Test arms use magnetic elasticity to provide an easy clipping, ergonomic, and long-lasting structure.Built-in dual lithium batteries in test arms, balancing both arms and providing a longer standby time.Several kinds of gold-plated interchangeable tweezer tips, enabling higher measurement accuracy in various usages.Automatically identify SMDs including resistor, capacitor, inductor, and diode, showing both main and secondary parameters.A built-in signal generator can output a variety of waveform signals.Specification:Product SpecificationsOperation time10 hrs (in continuous operation)  Charging time2 hrsDisplay96*16 OLEDSizeController47mmTest Arms106mmWeight22g  OperationHidden touch button  Measurement Specifications RangeResolutionAccuracyResistance0.1Ω~1KΩ0.1Ω0.5%+21KΩ~2000KΩ1KΩ0.5%+2Capacitance0.1pF~1000pF0.1pF2%+30.001uF~400uF0.001uF2%+3Inductance1uH~1000uH1uH5%+31mH~50mH1mH5%+3Voltage1mV~100mV1mV2%+50.1V~40V0.1V1%+3Frequency10Hz~1KHz10Hz0.1%+31KHz~20000KHz1KHz0.1%+3Diodesilicon diodes, Schottky diodes, LEDs (+0.1~3V)0.1V1%Max input voltage-5V~+50VSource Impedance1MΩFunctionsAutomatic IdentificationYesDesignated measurementsYesContinuity and Diode testingYesSignal generatorSINESupport: 10KHz, 5KHz, 2KHz, 1Khz, 500Hz, 200Hz NOISESupport: 100KHz USERSupport: 10KHz, 5KHz, 2KHz, 1Khz, 500Hz, 200Hz PULSESupport: 100KHz, 0KHz, 20Khz, 10KHz, 5KHz, 2KHz, 1Khz, 500Hz, 200HzPackage includes:1 x DT71 Controller 1 x Test Arms 2 x Tweezer Tips1 x Data Cable1 x Charging Cable1 x Carrying Case1 x User Manual>>Please Click Here to Download the English User Manual<<Details pictures:
