Q&A:Q: What is the difference between the UpgradeÂ 1S and the previous 1?A: 1S has added the function of adding your idle automatic discharge, which can automatically discharge to 50% in 5 days and extend the battery life. 1S also optimizes the circuit layout and structure, with better performance. In addition, type C charging port version is added to 1S.Q: What is the difference between type C and micro USB?A: Type C version uses type C charging port, supports positive and negative plugging, and distributes a type C charging line. In addition, the type C circuit uses the gold deposition process, which is more durable.Q: Does type C support fast charging?A: Considering that fast charging may affect battery life, it only takes about 2 hours to charge from 50% to 100%, so fast charging is not supported.Feature:Aluminum alloy shell material, fire-proof and anti-fall; Surface anodizing technology, anti-abrasive and safe to use.Portable Spot Welding Machine is mainly used in the welding of nickel sheet of cylindrical battery like 18650.Built-in high-rate polymer power cell, the maximum output current is up to 639A, and it can continuously weld thousands of points after being fully charged.With output power and remaining power indication, there are two output modes: timing trigger output and automatic trigger output. At the same time can sett 4 output power.Has four dual-color indicator lights, Green light for indicating the power, red light for indicating the welding power.Charging indicator light: red for charging, green for fully charged.It will automatically shut-down after ten minutes of no use.Compact size and light weight, easy and convenient to carry.Specifications:Item Type: Spot Welding MachineMaterial: Aluminum alloySize: 10x8.4x2.8cm/3.9x3.3x1.1inColor: BlackOutput Voltage: 4.2V(max)Output Current: 639A(max)Design current: 1200A(max)Battery Capacity: 4300mAhInput interface: Micro USBInput: 5V 1AWelding thickness: 0.1-0.12mmQuantity: 1 SetInstructions:Long press the power on button, the green light shows the electric quantity, the red light shows the output power.Short press twice to enter power setting, four gear power output, short press twice to save and exit.At this time, the welding is triggered at a fixed time, and the output is 1.5s once.Short press once to switch to automatic trigger mode, and automatically output when two welding pens are detected to be in good contact with nickel sheet.Long press to shut down.Package Includes:1 x Spot Welding Machine1 x Charging Cable2 x Spot Welding Pen1 x English User Manual >>>CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD<<<Detail Pictures:
