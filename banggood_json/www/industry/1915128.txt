Best Downsized Industrial High Power Laser Engraver & Cutter for business starters, hobbyists, designers, artists, home-makers, professionals.2. Better technologies (industrialized steel wheel&shaft, tension wheel, synchronous belt, Compressed light spot,etc.) makes the carving more precise and the carved works perfect. With more humanized designs, you can concentrate on your creation all the time.Better Laser Enhances Cutting & Engraving EffectUse innovative dual laser technology to combine two laser beams into one spot. The compressed spot has higher power, higher cutting ability, faster speed and better effect under the same electric power. The power of 10W dual laser xTool D1 is equivalent to a single laser 15W laser cutting machine.Easy Focus AdjustmentOnly take 3 steps to adjust the focus in 5 seconds. Pull down the original focus lever, slide the laser slider to make the focus lever close to the material's surface, recover the focus lever.Large Engraving AreaA large working area of 432*406mm ( 17*16 inch ), more than the size of A3 paper, allows you to engrave more patterns at once.

Industrialized steel wheel&shaft: professional motion structure design, up to 160mm/s motion speed and more accurately.2. The ultra-fine laser focus area,with the 0.08mm thin laser spot and 0.01mm ultra-high movement precision, it ensures more accurate cut lines and fewer burn marks.3. Innovative Dual Beam Design: Combine the beams of 2 laser modules to achieve 10W laser output.Processing speed reaches 160mm/s,easy to cut 6mm basswood.4. 432 * 406 mm (17 * 16 inch) Large engraving range to meet your various engraving needs.5. Industrialized steel material for both axle and wheel has longer product lifetime.6. More Function:Using additional raisers (sold separately ID:1915184) to increase the height of xTool D1 to facilitate the engraving of higher objects.Q&A1. What is the difference between the 5W and 10W models? How should I choose the device power?- 10W model supports more engraving materials, has finer engraving, and faster engraving speed compared to the 5W model.2. Other Laser machine laser power is 20W, why xTool D1-10W laser power is only 10W?- 20W is the laser power of other Laser machines, its actual laser output power should be 5W.The laser power xTool D1-10W is 36W, the actual laser output power is 10W, and xTool D1-10W uses compressed spot technology(the spot size is 0.08mm), the actual engraving effect can be same as of the ordinarys 15W machine.3. Why does the machine use steel wheels and steel shaft structures?- Compared to the plastic wheels and aluminum shafts, the industrial-grade steel wheels and shafts just make our machine have higher repeat positioning accuracy, higher motion stability, higher processing speed, and longer lifespan.4. Is it possible to engrave metal?- Yes, the xTool D1 uses compressed spot technology with a spot size of only 0.08mm and supports engraving stainless steel and various coated metals. laserBox D1 5W can achieve the engraving effect of a normal 7W device, and 10W can achieve the engraving effect of a normal 15W device.5. Is it possible to engrave cylinders?- Yes, xTool D1 can Perform Engraving on Cylindrical Objects with optional rotary attachment.6. What is the maximum thickness of material that the machine can cut?- xTool D1-5W can cut up to 4mm basswood board at one time, and xTool D1-10W can cut up to 6mm basswood board at one time.Package Included:1 x                               Machine1xrotary attachment8xRaiser1 xLaser1 x12V 7A Power Adapter1 xUSB Cable2 xConnection Cable1 xGoggles1 xLeather Label (gift)1 xBasswood Board (gift)1 xAluminium Sheet (gift)1 xStainless Steel Pet Tag (gift)1 xTF Card10 xRolled Belts3 xHexagonal Spanner1 xInstruction Card16 xScrew M4*84 xScrew M4*153 xScrew M4*25More Details:
