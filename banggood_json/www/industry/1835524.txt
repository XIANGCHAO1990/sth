Features:[Phone Size Design]: Super-thin body and pocket size design make it looks ike a real phone. Ideal for daily diy use, teachal use, or fashion use.[Large Screen 3 Line Display]: Large screen triple line display can show 3 test results on the screen, such as voltage, frequency and analog bar.[Automatic Identification Design]: Automatic identification design allows for no-switching when testing AC/DC voltage, Hz, continuity and resistance.[Flashlight Design]: Flashlight design makes measurement more efficient. Hang hole design make it more portable.[Unibody Design]: Unibody design, no need to plug in, out probes, which not only can save learning and test time, but also prevent wrong insertion of ports, which may burn out the multimeter.[Automatic Measurement and Protection Function]: Automatic measurement range and full range overload protection function, the maximum display value is 9999.[Multi-function Test Design]: It can be used for temperature, NCV, voltage, resistance, capacitance, frequency, duty cycle, diode, continuity, and live test.[Auto Power Off Function]: After 5 minutes, the multimeter will automatically turn off any input signal to save power.[Ambient temperature measurement]:With temperature measurement function, temperature unit °C/°F switch function[Rechargeable]: Come with a rechargeable li-ion battery & charging cable, you will never worry about power problem.[EMF Tester(Only MT11 Pro)]: Integrated electromagnetic radiation tester design greatly enhance your experience, suitable for home, office, factory, outdoor, etc.Specification:Display: 9999 countsScreen: 3.5 inchDC Voltage: 0.8V-620V ±(0.5%+3); Resolution: 0.001VAC Voltage: 2.2V-620V ±(0.5%+5); Resolution: 0.001VResistance: 1Ω-999.9Ω ±(2.0%+5); 1kΩ-60MΩ ±(1.0%+3); Resolution: 0.11ΩCapacitance: 1nF-999.9nF ±(6.0%+5); 1uF-99.99mF ±(3.0%+3); Resolution: 0.001nFFrequency: 1Hz-1000Hz ±(1.0%+5) (ACV:2V-10V); Resolution: 0.001Hz1KHz-60KHz ±(1.0%+5) (ACV:10V-620V); Resolution: 0.001HzDuty Cycle: 0.1%-99.9% ±(3.0%+5) (ACV:2V-620V); Resolution: 0.1%Diode: Auto identify diode if less than 3.0VV-Alert(non-contact voltage detection): beep alarm soundsLive Check: alarm beep sounds, LCD screen display stripeContinuity: If the resistance is less than 30Ω, the beeper soundsPower: 1*Li-ion 800mAhPackage Size: 147*85*42mmPackage Weight: 180gPackage Includes:1 * Multimeter 1 * Test lead  1 * English user manual 1 * Packing box1 * USB charging cable( only for MT11 & MT11Pro )1 * EVA portable cloth bag( only for MT11 & MT11Pro )1 * Protective shellDetails Picture:
