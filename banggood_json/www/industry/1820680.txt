Please read the user manual carefully before use to avoid damaging the device.>>User Guide and Software<< Package Includes:SAA-2N host (inside 3000mAh battery) x 1Micro USB data cable x150cm N-type male to male RG142-PUR RF cable x2N-type male calibration kit - OPEN x1N-type male calibration kit - SHORT x1N-type male calibration kit - LOAD x1N-type female to female connector x1Touch screen paddles and lanyard x1EVA storage bag x1
