Description:
		6 mosfet dual mode controller for lithium battery

		Rated working voltage: 24v/36v/48v/60v

		Power available :250W/350W

		Max current available: 10A-20A (default setting 13a)

		Battery voltage undervoltage protection point: 19v/30v/41v/52v

		Fit for motor phase angle: 60degree/120 degree (automatic learn )

		 

Controller Feature:

		1. Automatically indentify motor phase and angle. 
		You can learn with debug wire. operation method: connect power cable, main switch wire, motor wire,
		hall wire, handle bar wire, learning wire, switch on power and bike lock, the motor will start to work. 
		If the turning direction is right, please cut off learning wire. The learning is finished.
		If direction is opposite, please cut off learning wire, the motor will switch direction automatically,
		work 2-3 seconds, cut off learning wire, the learning is finished.( attention please !cut off learning wire after learning)
		 

		2. dual mode (When motor hall work normally, controller work with hall mode.

		(other controller if not double mode, cannot work if motor hall damaged)
		 

		3. can control and match with other electric parts

		such as can match with external speed test sensor, so that display can indicate speed 
		even when bike is in sliding. can match with brake sensor, can match with left shifter work as ebs brake and so on.
		 

		4. when battery voltage is not enough the controller will automatically lower current, this will protect your battery for longer life.
