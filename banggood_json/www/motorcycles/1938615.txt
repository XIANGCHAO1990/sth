Description:﻿1. This is a multifunctional code reading card that integrates OBD general detection, battery detection, and printing (serial port printing). It provides accurate vehicle detection, battery detection, and printing test results. Product introduction V313 A trolley code reading card product,It has the following functions:1. Support nine OBD II/EOBD standard protocols;2. Support OBD functions such as vehicle fault diagnosis and real-time data streaming;3. With data playback functions such as viewing the saved fault code information, data flow and battery detection;4. Data with emission testing5. The data saved in the code reading card can be printed through the USB serial port;6. Support USB upgrade function7. German, Dutch, English, Spanish, French, Italian8. Quickly test the cold start current, internal resistance, battery life and remaining power of the 12V start-up lead-acid battery to determine whether the battery needs to be replaced: real-time voltage detection, battery impedance detection, and how much power is left after a period of full charge (SOC ) Battery charging current value (SOH), cold start current detection (CCA)Supported vehicle data：Read error diagnostic codeClear the error code and turn off the MIL ("Check Engine" indicator light)Engine revolutions per minute (RPM)Calculated load valueCoolant temperatureFuel system statusSpeedShort-term fuel situationLong-term fuel situationIntake manifold pressureFuel injection advance timeIntake air temperatureAir SpeedAbsolute position of throttle valveOxygen detection voltage associated with short-term fuel stateFuel system statusFuel pressureThere are many other data for fuel consumption monitoring...Note: The number of data items supported by different model years is also different, and the actual support situation shall prevail.Supported protocolsSAE J1850 PWM (41.6 Kbaud)SAE J1850 VPW (10.4 Kbaud)ISO 9141-2 (5 baud init, 10.4 Kbaud)ISO 14230-4 KWP (5 baud init, 10.4 Kbaud)ISO 14230-4 KWP (fast init, 10.4 Kbaud)ISO 15765-4 CAN (11bit ID, 500 Kbaud)ISO 15765-4 CAN (29bit ID, 500 Kbaud)ISO 15765-4 CAN (11bit ID, 2500 Kbaud)ISO 15765-4 CAN (29bit ID, 250 Kbaud)Specification：Technical parameters Main control chip STM32F103VET6working voltageDC 12VWorking current 98mAOperating environment -20～70℃Storage temperature-20～80℃Dimensions 181.5*81*29mmPackage Included:1 XOBD2 Scanner
