﻿Specification:NamePure sine wave power inverterInput voltageDC 12V/24V/48V/60V for your choiceOutput voltageAC 220VOutput frequency60HzPeaks Power4000W(Maximum Active Surge Rating which is less than 1 second)Rated power2000WMaximum AC Current per socke8.33AmpereOutput WaveformTrue/pure sine wave (<3% THD)Efficiency90≥% No Load Current Draw (DC side) <0.6 A;Note:The theoretical actual power is 2000WChristmas Event Page Please CLICK.Features：1.PURE SINE WAVE: PURE SINE WAVE INVERTER - Converts 12V/24V/48V/60V DC to AC 220V household wall power with continuous 2000-4000W output, LED Voltage display, high current DC terminals and two LED work lights. (Please make sure that the total rated power of the connected devices is ≤ continuous power of inverter).2.Strong and Durable: Aluminum alloy housing and high speed Intelligent cooling fan helps reduce heat . Aluminum alloy housing provides advanced protection from drops and bumps. Integrated cooling fan helps reduce heat and prevents shortages.(Note: It is normal for the metal shell to heat up when the inverter is working. This inverter uses a built-in fan and the metal shell to dissipate heat).3.LED Green&Red Work Lights: When inverter work normal, the green LED Lights work, but when it is on protection status, the Red Led Lights will light up.4.Silent Intelligent Cooling Fan: Equipped with silent cooling fan, it will automatically runs at different speed according to power load (watt) load and temperature for dissipating heat and reducing working noise. There is a temperature sensor built in the inverter. When it is over 45℃, the fans will work automatically. When the temperature is over 75 ℃-80 ℃, the inverter will be shut down.Package Include:1 x2-4KW Pure Sine Wave Power Inverter (12V/24V Set)1 pair of 10 square line battery clips(48V/60V Set) 1 pair of 6 square line battery clip +1 x electric car special wire
