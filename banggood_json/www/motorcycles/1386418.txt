	Q&A:

		1.Can I install the kit on my 18 speed/24 speed bike?

		Yes, you can. But it is more difficult to install. This kit is designed for normal bike, not for the bike that can shift gears. However, you can install the kit on the left hand side if your bike is18speed/24speed... you need to mount the freewheel on the left hand side on your rear wheel axis, and spot weld to secure it. After you have installed the kit , you can still shift gears on your bike. But if you don't know how to weld, we recommend you to buy our hub motor kit or our “mid-mounted" kit . 

		 

		2. What battery is recommended for this kit?

		This kit is of 36V, you need three 12V batteries, (lead acid or lithium), or one 36V battery.After they are linked together, the recommended capacity >12AH

		 

		3.Is the kit include batteries?

		No, the kit includes all the parts you need except batteries to convert the bike into electric bike.You need to buy the batteries by yourself.

		 

		4.Where should I mount the batteries ?

		We do not provide the battery box. But you can install it above the rear wheel on rear rack, or even make a box(need some DIY skills).You can design whether the batteries can take out or hard wired.
