Description:2000W/3000W/4000W Power Inverter Pure Sine Wave Transformer 12V/24V to 220V Auto Specifications:Product NamePure Sine Wave Power InverterTypeSolar inverterOutput Voltage WaveformPure sine wavePower2000w/ 3000w /4000wOutput Voltage220vInput Voltage12v / 24vOutput Frequency50HzLow-Voltage Protection9.5v / 20vHigh-pressure Protection16v / 30vConversion Rate93% or moreSize29*12*7CM(2000W) / 30*15*7CM(3000W) / 35*15*7CM(4000w)Quantity1 Set × Pure Sine Wave Power Inverter Features:1. Double LED digital display.2. Aluminum-alloy shell, light weight, good thermal conductivity, can quickly reduce thetemperature of components, work long hours are not affected.3. Using chip technology, high reliability, seismic resistance, solder joint defect rate is low, reducingbattery and radio frequency interference.4. Eight intelligent protection, overload protection, high voltage protection, low voltage protection, overtemperature protection, reverse polarity protection, short circuit protection,Overcurrent protection,Insurance protection.5. Pure sine wave, smart filter, no interference on the electrical, to protect electrical appliances.6. Up to 93% conversion rate, reduce the conversion loss of 30%, increase 30% continuous power.7. High-precision circuit board.8. Built-in intelligent control chip.9. Intelligent temperature control fan, make the inverter more quiet. When the temperature ≤ 45 ℃, the fanstops working, when the temperature ≥ 45 ℃, the fan began to work.10. Buzzer reminder device. Once any protection of the inverter is triggered, the inverter immediately disconnectsthe power supply and the load enters a protection mode and reminds people through a buzzer reminder.11. Screw terminal. Pluggable plug, easy to replace the cable.12. Dual cooling fans to extend the life of the inverter.13. Universal three-hole socket, strong compatibility,most appliances are suitable.14. Low standby power consumption, high conversion rate.15. Intelligent chip control, complete protection. Package Included:1 X Inverter1 XUser Manual1 XUltra-thick Battery Cable
