Description:New technology-Different from other full-spectrum growth lamps, 800W long lamp with 24 unique large reflector cups and 168PCS 5W LED chip. 16 LED light strips constitute a real full-light plant light, which helps plants, vegetables and flowers grow indoors at various stages, and will get 36% higher than the old LED light.VEG & BLOOM Dimming Knob-Easily control the light according to different plant growth stages. The blue light (VEG) channel helps photo synthesis promote green leaf growth, protein synthesis and fruit formation; the red light (BLOOM) channel promotes plant growth, helps flowers and prolongs the flowering period. Especially add UV, infrared and white (3000k-6500k). The perfect light speed meter, suitable for all plant seeds, growth and blooming.Low energy consumption-using the highest PAR/LUMEN output consumes only 150W, which saves up to 50% of energy compared to other LED lights. Fits 2.5x2.5 feet, and the maximum coverage area is 3.5x3.5 feet. More than 97% of the light energy can be absorbed by plants.Daisy chain and 2 fan cooling systems-The power cord is used for both power supply and daisy chain, which is ideal for you to simplify the growing operation and management, while using only wall sockets to connect more grow lights. We recommend using a total of 5 LED long lights with the same power as the daisy chain, and please pay attention to the most commonly used current in the home. In addition, equipped with 2 silent fans, the heat will be quickly dissipated to ensure the long life of the LED lights.Voltage: 100-260V Frequency: 50/60Hz Power: 120W (Compared to 800W high pressure sodium lamp in the field of plant growth lamps)Package includes:1 x LED Grow Light1 x Charger
