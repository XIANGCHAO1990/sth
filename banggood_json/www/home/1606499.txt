Product Description:

	★ High Cost-Effictive High Efficiency:

	Feature afford price with energy-saving. Save 90% energy compared traditional LED Light.Covers a full 2' x 2'/4' x 4' ,easily replace a 300W/600W while consuming 100/200 watts of actual power.Suitable for 100*100*180cm/120*120*200cm grow tent(not included).

	★ New Upgraded LED chips:

	less heat release than other general grow light led's 1/3,High Par Value and High Lumen,Minimum Heat, Maximum Growth High par value(photosynthetically active radiation)ensured high light absorption of plants to maximize the plant growth and harvest. Higher lumen and long lifespan ensured.


	★ Upgraded New generation PVC-steel Frame:

	lighter than other general led grow light panels,against friction, pressure,with long service life.high compressive strength and compression strength.Keeping heat off plants is essential.By using self-cooling aluminum and a unique heat sink design to maximize heat dissipation area, the LED maintains a cooler temperature even after 24 hours of continuous use.
