Description:
This motorized ball valve is made of solid brass, will fully open or fully close in 5~15 seconds. Once in position, it automatically stops using energy. This is important as it will never overheat.This is a key difference between motorized ball valves and solenoid valves. Most solenoid valves are constantly energized, while these electrical ball valves are not, making them a safer and more eco-friendly option.
