Specifications:

	Color: Silver
	Material: Metal
	Size: Approx. 60 x 52 x 27mm / 2.36 x 2.05 x 1.06''
	Input Voltage: DC 6-40V (10V to 40V is suggested)
	Output Voltage: DC 1.2-36V
	Output Current: 20A(max.), 15A (suggested)
	Efficiency: 97% (24V to 12V, 20A)
	Output Ripple: ≤50mV
	Wiring Method: Terminal
	Short Circuit Protection: Self-recovery (cannot short circuit for a long time)
	VO+: Output positive
	VO-: Output negative
	+IN: Input positive
	-IN: Input negative
	CV: Output voltage adjustment
	CC: Output current adjustment
	EN: Enable, low voltage level shut off output; suspension, high voltage level is effective
	When input and output is common grounded, no-load CV output constant voltage, CC output constant current
	Working Tempreture: -10°C-75°C

Features:

	With a wide input voltage range from 6V to 40V, the step-down converter can accurately adjust output voltage and current
	The efficiency can be up to 96%, measured at 20A, converting 24V to 12V
	Designed with 75V/80A large current dual MOS tube
	The buck module has 2 heat sink that could enhance heat dissipation
	Wiring is convenient with these large current 30A screw terminals
	Input and output use high frequency low resistance electrolytic capacitor, low ripple, stable output
	Stable and reliable
	Fine workmanship and durable

Package included:

	1 x 300W 20A adjustable step-down converter module
