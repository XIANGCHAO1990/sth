Description:

	 

Operating voltage:DC 4 ~ 30V

Measure voltage: DC 0 ~ 100V

Minimum resolution(V): 0.1V

Measure current :50A (require external shunt)

Minimum resolution(A): 0.1A

Operating current: <20mA

Display: three 0.28" LED digital tube

Display color: Red and Red

Refresh rate: about 300mS / times

Measure accuracy: 1% (± 1 digit)

Operating temperature: -10 to 65° c

Operating Humidity: 10 to 80% (non-condensing)

Working pressure: 80 to 106 kPa

Applications:Suitable for automotive/electric cars/motorcycles battery monitoring or other products voltage current measurement

	 

Wiring:

	 

Black line (thin): vacant or buck circuit (module) negative

Red line (thin): power supply+

Black line (thick): COM, common measuring

Red line (thick): PW+, measuring terminal voltage input positive

Yellow line (thick): IN+, current input+

	 

Notice:

	 

The voltage between the thin red and thin black lines must be within DC 4-30V

The ammeter can only be connected to the negative of the device under test

Exceeds 5A, long-term full load working continuously, it is recommended that the measurement side of the leads are directly soldered to the socket

When the black thin line vacant, it is better to use insulating tape around the exposed part of the wire, to prevent short circuits

If just be used as a voltmeter, it is recommended that the yellow line and the black line were connected together, to prevent the ammeter digital flashing

It is unsuitable to use this meter to test current less than 10A .

	 

Package included

	 

1 x Digital Voltmeter Ammeter Meter

1 x Current Shunt

1 x Cable
