Description:M5Paper v1.1 is M5Stacks latest core device with a touch enabled E-ink display. Powered by the ESP32-D0WDQ6-V3 this is our first device to integrate a super sized 540*960 @4.7" E-ink display，which supports 16 grayscale levels. The display is a GT911 capacitive touch screen，which supports two point touch and a variety of gesture controls . Compared to a regular LCD，E-ink displays are easier on the eyes, which makes them a great choice for reading or viewing for longer periods. Other benefits are the low power consumption and the ability to retain the image even if power to the display is terminated. Integrated in the CoreInk are an multi-function button for operation, SHT30 temperature and moisture sensor, physical buttons and an TF-card(microSD) port for data storage.Additionally the FM24C02 internal eeprom chip provided 2K-bit(256x8)-EEPROM can be used to store vital data even when the device is off. A 1150mAh lipo battery keeps the device going for long periods and battery life can be further preserved by using the RTC(BM8563)to set the device into deep sleep and wake it up again when needed。Three HY2.0-4P expansion ports are included which allow for building complex projects using the existing sensors in the M5Stack ecosystem.Warning: Do not expose to ultraviolet rays for a long time, otherwise it may cause irreversible damage to the E-ink screen. The low-power power management solution adopted by M5Paper is different from that of CORE and StickC devices. When in use, the PWR button is used as a power-on button(long press 2s). If you need to shut down the device, you need to use the software API or press the reset button on the back, when using USB power supply, it cannot be shut down.Features:ESP32 Standard wireless functions WiFi、BluetoothInternal 16M FlashLow Power DisplayMulti-Point touch screen180 degree viewing angleBuilt-in MagnetInternal 1150mAh BatteryExpandable - HY2.0-4P 3 x external expansion portsApplications:IoT TerminalE-BookIndustrial Control PanelSmart Home PanelPackage Included:1x M5Paper v1.1Document:EasyLoaderPinMapM5Paper-HY2.0 4P PortESP32 ADC/DAC Mappable PinsRelated LinkExampleSchematicVideo
