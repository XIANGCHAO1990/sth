>>>Manual: Click here to open<<<Principle:The QRM canceller is inserted into the feeder of the antenna from thetrx without any other modifications to the radio. The box has a built-in PTT control to keep the canceller connected during transmission. However, an additional auxiliary receiving antenna is required, such as a 2m antenna or only a few meters of wires in a shed. The two antennas receive unwanted signals, resulting in different phases. The QRM canceller now allows adjustment of the phase angle and amplification to cancel out unwanted signals before they reach the front end of the receiver! It is based on a completely innovative concept and cannot be compared with the normal "silencer" performance.PCB:1. PCB: 73 *85 *1.6mm2. Weight: 55gPackage includes:(optional: Bare board/with shell)1 x QRM cancellerÂ
