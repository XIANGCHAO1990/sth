ESP32-CAM is a WIFI+ bluetooth dual-mode development board that uses PCB on-board antennas and cores based on ESP32 chips. It can work independently as a minimum system.         2. ESP integrates WiFi, traditional bluetooth and BLE Beacon, with 2 high-performance 32-bit LX6 CPUs, 7-stage pipeline architecture, main frequency adjustment range 80MHz to 240MHz, on-chip sensor, Hall sensor, temperature sensor, etc.         3. Fully compliant with WiFi 802.11b/g/n/e/i and bluetooth 4.2 standards, it can be used as a master mode to build an independent network controller, or as a slave to other host MCUs to add networking capabilities to existing devices.         4. ESP32-CAM can be widely used in various IoT applications. It is suitable for home smart devices, industrial wireless control, wireless monitoring, QR wireless identification, wireless positioning system signals and other IoT applications. It is an ideal solution for IoT applications.    Features:          - Ultra-small 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi + BT/BLE SoC module  - Low-power dual-core 32-bit CPU for application processors  - Up to 240MHz, up to 600 DMIPS  - Built-in 520 KB SRAM, external 4M PSRAM  - Supports interfaces such as UART/SPI/I2C/PWM/ADC/DAC  - Support OV2640 and OV7670 cameras with built-in flash  - Support for images WiFI upload  -Support TF card  - Support multiple sleep modes  - Embedded Lwip and FreeRTOS  - Support STA/AP/STA+AP working mode  - Support Smart Config/AirKiss One-click distribution network  - Support for serial local upgrade and remote firmware upgrade (FOTA)      - Support secondary development          Note:          This product contains the OV2640 Camera Module. If you need to use the OV7670 camera, please purchase it separately.          Package Included:          1 x ESP32-CAM Module  1 x Camera Module OV2640 2MP  Product Specifications:              Module model           ESP32-CAM             Package           DIP-16             Size           27*40.5*4.5(±0.2)mm             SPI Flash           default 32Mbit             RAM           internal520KB+external 4M PSRAM             bluetooth           bluetooth4.2BR/EDR and BLE standards             Wi-Fi           802.11 b/g/n/e/i             Support interface           UART, SPI, I2C, PWM             Support TF card           Maximum support 4G             IO port           9             Serial port rate           default 115200 bps             Image output format           JPEG (only supported by OV2640), BMP, GRAYSCALE             Spectrum range           2412 ~ 2484MHz             Antenna form           onboard PCB antenna , gain 2dBi             Transmit power           802.11b: 17±2 dBm (@11Mbps)          802.11g: 14±2 dBm (@54Mbps)          802.11n: 13±2 dBm (@MCS7)             Receiving sensitivity           CCK, 1 Mbps : -90dBm          CCK, 11 Mbps: -85dBm          6 Mbps (1/2 BPSK): -88dBm          54 Mbps (3/4 64-QAM): -70dBm          MCS7 (65 Mbps, 72.2 Mbps): -67dBm             Power consumption           Turn off the flash: 180mA@5V          Turn on the flash and adjust the brightness to the maximum: 310mA@5V          Deep-sleep: The lowest power consumption can reach 6mA@5V          Moderm-sleep: up to 20mA@5V          Light-sleep: up to 6.7mA@5V             Security           WPA/WPA2/WPA2-Enterprise/WPS             Power supply range           5V             Operating temperature           -20 °C ~ 85 °C             Storage environment           -40 °C ~ 90 °C, < 90%RH     ESP32-CAM Picture Output Format Rate:                          QQVGA           QVGA           VGA           SVGA             JPEG           6           7           7           8             BMP           9           9           -           -             GRAYSCALE           9           8           -           -         Test environment: camera model: OV2640 XCLK: 20MHz, the module transmits pictures to the computer browser by WiFi.
