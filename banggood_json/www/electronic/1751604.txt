>>>Manual: Click here to open<<<Note: For the DIY kit, the user needs to have basic electronic knowledge, please check the manual before purchasing to make sure it can be used. Please purchase carefully to avoid unnecessary disputes. Thanks.Description:The weather station uses the ESP8266-12E to obtain data from the Internet: time of a city, weather data and forecast information for the next 3 days, scrolling on the SSD1306 OLED Display; the device can switch to display data from any city in the world - maybe your relatives or friends live thereThe device uses sensors DHT11, BMP180,BH1750FVI to collect temperature, humidity, Atmosphetic Pressure and light data. The weather station reads data indoor via sensor every 5 seconds and uploads it to the Internet every 60 seconds.You can see real-time data charts from your phone or computer.Of course you can modify the code to implement different functionsESP8266: CP2102 chip inside,Micro USB,4MB flash,full I/O port and wireless 802.11 supported with IOT platform.DHT11 Sensor: A digital signal output with a calibrated temperature and humidity combined sensor.The simple communication protocol greatly reduces the programming effort requiredBMP180: high-precision, small size, ultra-low power 3μA pressure sensor.Its performance excellence, the absolute accuracy of the lowest can reach 0.03hPa.Can directly through the I2C bus connected with a variety of microprocessors.Pressure range: 300 ~ 1100hPa.BH1750FVI: Digital Light intensity Sensor.Direct digital output, complex calculation is omitted, omitting calibration.OLED Yellow Blue Display :0.96" SSD1306 128X64 Yellow&Blue OLED LCD Display with I2C IIC SPI Serial Result:1) Get weather data from OpenWeathermap at regular intervals, showing the weather of today and weather forecast for next 3 days in any city in the world2) Read the current temperature, humidity data indoor at regular intervals3) Regular reading of atmospheric pressure, light intensity data4) Upload temperature,humidity,atmospheric pressure and intensity of illumination data to thingspeak.com at regular intervals5) View weather forecast on OLED display and view environmental monitoring chart on thingspeak.comGuidance Step:Overview：This manual describes how to make a miniature weather station by IDEStep 1: Install USB-To-SerialStep 2: Install IDE for ESP8266Step 3: Burning Firmware to ESP8266Step 4: Connecting ComponentsStep 5: Register OpenWeathermap, thingspeak new accountStep 6: Import WeatherStation code in the IDEStep 7: Add LibraryStep 8: Modify File WeatherStation.inoStep 9: Set the Board and Port againStep 10: Burn code to ESP8266Step 11: ResultPackage Included:1 x ESP8266-12E1 x DHT111 x BMP1801 x BH1750FVI1 x OLED Display1 x USB Cable2 x Breadboard20 x Dupont Cable
