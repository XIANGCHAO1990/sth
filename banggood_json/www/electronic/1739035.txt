Description:Balance instructions:1. When the equalization light is on, the equalization work is turned on,2. The equalization light goes out and the equalization circuit sleeps,3. The equalization light flashes, the string is dropped, or the circuit is faulty.Principle of equilibrium:This module is adjacent to the pressure difference equalization, the adjacent battery voltage difference reaches more than 0.1V, and the internal chip triggers the equalization work until the adjacent battery voltage difference is within 0.03V, and there is adjacent pressure difference when used on the battery pack. Triggering the equalization work, the battery pack voltage error will also be pulled back to a more ideal value, reducing battery maintenance costs.Specification:The working voltage is 2.0V-4.5V, ternary iron lithium battery is universal, LTO lithium titanate battery is not applicable.Balance current:The adjacent voltage difference is above 0.1V (current is about 0.5-0.7A);The adjacent voltage difference is more than 0.2V (reach the maximum equalization current 1.2A);The smaller the pressure difference, the smaller the equalizing current.Wiring definition:B-, the total negative pole of the battery pack (the negative pole of the first battery)B1, the positive terminal of the first batteryB2, the positive pole of the second batteryB3...and so on.Package included:1 x Board1 x 30cm pure copper 22awg terminal wire
