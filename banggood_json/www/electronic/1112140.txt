Specifications:

Resistor: 0.1ω-50Mω
		Capacitor: 25pF-100000uF
		Inductance: 0.01mH - 20H
		Working power: DC-9V
		Standby current: 0.02uA
		Operating current: 25mA
		Material: Metal+Plastic
		Size: about 11.1cm/4.37"x2.6cm / 1.02"x8.5cm/3.34"
		[Conversion: 1cm=0.3937 inch, 1inch=2.54 cm]

Description:

1. Add boot voltage detection function
		2. Automatic detection of NPN and PNP transistors, N -channel and P-channel MOSFET, diodes (including dual diode), thyristors, transistors, resistors and capacitors and other components
		3. Automatic test out the pin element and displayed on the LCD
		4. Can be detected to determine the transistor emitter forward bias voltage of the transistor, MOSFET protection diode and the amplification factor of the base
		5. Measure the gate threshold voltage and gate capacitance of the MOSFET
		6. 1602 lcd display uses LCD (12864 LCD with backlight)
		7. High test speed, valid component test: 2 seconds (except in the larger capacitor of large capacitance measurement also takes a long time, the measured time of one minute is normal)
		8. One button operation, power-on test, get a key
		9. Power consumption off mode: less than 20 nA of
		10. Auto power off function to avoid unnecessary waste, saving battery power, improved battery life

Note:

Battery is not included.

Package included:

1 x LCR-T4 Transistor Tester
