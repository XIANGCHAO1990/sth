Features:

	 

- Fixed turn lamp current is 0.1 times the current value ( Used to identify whether the battery is fully charged When charging).

- Made from a dedicated benchmark IC and high-precision current sensing resistor, proving a more stable constant current, (when 20°C to 100°C constant current 1A, temperature drift less than 1%). Particularly suitable for LED.

- High output current, the max output current can reach 8A.

- Four high frequency capacitance, can lower output ripple, enhance the work stabilization.

- Double heat sink design. MOS schottky diode independent heat sink,which heat dissipation is good,and won’t affect each other.

- Using large size Sendust Core and double pure copper wiring, improve working efficiency, reduce fever.

- 3296 multiturn potentiometer,high accuracy voltage and current regulation, good stability.

- Double color lamp, working condition be clear at a glance

- Voltage and current are adjustable,wich effect is good.

	 

Parameters:

	 

- Module Properties: Non-isolated step-down constant current, constant voltage module (CC CV) charging module

- Input Voltage: DC 7-32V

- Output Voltage: (1) DC 1.2-28V continuously adjustable. (2) Fixed output:Choose between 0.8v-28v

- Output Current: 8A (when power tube's temperature exceeds 65 degrees, please add cooling fan)

- Constant Current Range: 0.2-8A (Adjustable)

- Turn Lamp Current: Constant current value * (0.1), turn the lamp current and constant value linkage, such as constant current value is 3A, turn the lamp current is set to a constant current is 0.1 times (0.1 * 3A = 0.3A)

- Lowest Pressure: 1V

- Output Power: Maximum power is about 200W

- Conversion Efficiency: Up to about 95%

- Operating Frequency: 300KHZ

- Output Ripple: 20M bandwidth

- Input 24V output 12V 5A ripple around 50mV (Excluding noise)

- Output Short Circuit Protection: Yes, constant current

- Input Reverse Polarity Protection: None

- Output Prevent Backflow: None

- Wiring: Terminal

- No-Load Current: Typical 20mA (24V switch 12V)

- Load Regulation: ± 1% (Constant)

- Voltage Regulation: ± 1%

- Dynamic ResponseSpeed: 5% 200uS

- Potentiometer Adjustment Direction: clockwise (increase) , counterclockwise (decrease), the potentiometer(CV) closed to the input voltage is used to regulate voltage, the potentiometer(CC) closed to output voltage is used to regulate current (CC)

- Operating Temperature: Industrial grade (-40 °C to +85 °C) (please note the actual use of the power tube temperature , high temperature heat strengthened)

- Indicator: dual color indicator, charging indicator light is red, the green light means fully charged (No load is green)

- Size: Approx. 65 x 47 x 23.5mm/2.56 x 1.85 x 0.93''

- Precision of Constant Current and Temperature: On the actual test, the module temperature from 25 degrees to 60 degrees, the constant current value change is less than 5% (5A constant current value)

- Output Short Circuit Protection: Yes,Constant current (the current setting constant current value)

- Input Reverse Connect Protection: NO

- Output Prevent Reverse Fow: NO

- Wiring Method: Amphenol connector
