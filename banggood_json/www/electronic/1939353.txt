Overview:This is a kind of fine quality spots welding machine control board, high power output design, 99 gears of output power adjustable, more accurate welding, and it can continuously welding thousands of points on nickle/nickelplate sheet. The welding spots are accurate and beautiful, support welding 0.05-0.3mm nickel sheet, iron sheet, stainless steel sheet.Â Power Supply Requirements :1. The old lead-acid storage battery cell 12V 20AH-80AH or 4-5S Super Farad Capacitor. If the battery is used for more than one year, it should use a larger power, more than 100AH.(the new battery cannot exceed 45AH, if it exceeds 45AH, the tube will explode).2. 12V Jump Starters for car emergency start, it must be EC5 interface.3. 3S-4S 25C-60C model aircraft battery, the output cable should be XT60.NOTE:It is forbidden to use switching power supplies, transformer, chargers, and power banks for power supply, which will damage the circuit board.Features:1. It adopts 5pcs MOS tubes, and the max current is up to 2390A.2. High power output design, 99 gears of output power adjustable, more accurate welding, and it can continuously welding thousands of points on nickle/nickelplate sheet.3. The welding is based on the principle of high-current and high-temperature rapidly melting the part of nickel sheets and cooling.4. It equipped with 2pcs copper bars, which are greatly increase the overcurrent capacity.5. The welding spots are accurate and beautiful, support welding 0.05-0.3mm nickel sheet, iron sheet, stainless steel sheet.6. This spots welding machine can be used to spots welding cylindrical lithium batteries and nickel-metal hydride batteries like 14650/17490/18650/21700/26650/32650 and etc.Specifications:Name: Spots Welding Machine Control BoardMaterial: printed circuit boardSpot welding line: 6 square 25cm / 10 square 30cmSpot Welding Thickness:6 square spot welding pen can point 0.05-0.2mm10 square spot welding pen can point 0.05-0. 3mmItem size: 80 * 45mm / 3.15 * 1.77inPackage size: 145 * 85 * 105mm / 5.71 * 3.35 * 4.13inPackage weight: 350g / 12.35ouncePrecautions:1. Lead-acid batteries, new batteries above 45AH, must extend the line connecting the battery to the spot welder to about 50 cm, otherwise there is a risk of tube explosion.2. Do not try nickel chips over 0.15M, otherwise there is a risk of tube explosion.3. When debugging, if you find that the power is not enough, please increase the gears one by one to test, do not skip the gear operation.4. If the battery to be welded is an old battery, please be sure to grind the plain solder joints to keep the contact surface to be welded clean (no rust), otherwise it will cause overload due to the large welding contact resistance, and the solder joints will be lighter.If it turns black and heavy, there is a risk of blowing the tube.5. When welding, if there is no compression, the sparks are very large, and the solder joints are black and fried, which is caused by the unfamiliarity of personal operating skills. Press lightly, the welding pen tilted, and the spot welding trigger needs to stay for 2 seconds.Package Included:1 x Spots Welding Machine Control Board KIT
