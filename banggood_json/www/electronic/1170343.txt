Features:     This board/chip uses I2C 7-bit address between 0x60-0x80, selectable with jumpers  Terminal block for power input (or you can use the 0.1" breakouts on the side)  Reverse polarity protection on the terminal block input  Green power-good LED  3 pin connectors in groups of 4 so you can plug in 16 servos at once (Servo plugs are slightly wider than 0.1" so you can only stack 4 next to each other on 0.1" header  "Chain-able" design  A spot to place a big capacitor on the V+ line (If you need it)  220 ohm series resistors on all the output lines to protect them, and to make driving LEDs trivial  Solder jumpers for the 6 address select pins  i2c-controlled PWM driver with a built in clock. Unlike the TLC5940 family, you do not need to continuously send it signal tying up your microcontroller, its completely free running!  It is 5V compliant, which means you can control it from a 3.3V microcontroller and still safely drive up to 6V outputs (this is good for when you want to control white or blue LEDs with 3.4+ forward voltages)  6 address select pins so you can wire up to 62 of these on a single i2c bus, a total of 992 outputs - that's a lot of servos or LEDs  Adjustable frequency PWM up to about 1.6 KHz  12-bit resolution for each output - for servos, that means about 4us resolution at 60Hz update rate  Configurable push-pull or open-drain output  Output enable pin to quickly disable all the outputs    Package included:   1 x PCA9685 16-Channel 12-bit PWM Servo Motor Driver I2C Module For  Robot
