Description: 3S 12.6V 40A lithium battery protection board (comes with recovery function-AUTO Recovery) Scope: Nominal voltage of 3.7V lithium battery (including 18650,26650, polymer lithium battery) Product Size: 41 * 60 * 3.4mm (Balanced version) Charging voltage: 12.6V - 13.6V Continuous discharge current (upper limit): 40A (if the cooling environment is not good, please reduce the load current ) Continuous charge current (upper limit): 20A Balanced version: Suitable for electric drill with starting current below 80A and power below 170W .(with balanced charging function)  Note 1: To successful starting the drill requires three 15C-20C power batteries, or six 10C-15C power batteries (ordinary 18650 battery can not start the drill!!).  Note 2: When you wiring 0V, 4.2V, 8.4V, 12.6V, please do it strictly according to the wiring diagram.Do not deliberately make it short circuit.  Note 3: When the battery is charging,the "430" resistance heating is normal,it means the balance circuit is working.If the "430" resistance is also heating without charging,please check if the wrong wire is connected.  Note 4: Do not use a mix of good battery and poor battery,please make sure each battery is the same in capacity and internal resistance. Note 5: balanced charge is only auxiliary functions, try not to put a good battery and poor battery mixed together! 3 sets of battery capacity / resistance closer to the better! (2 good battery +1 Poor battery use effect = 3 poor battery use effect). Package included:1/3/5/10 x BMS 3S 40A 18650 Lithium Battery Protection Board (quantity optional)
