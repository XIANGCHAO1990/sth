3D
 Printer TOUCH is an auto leveling sensor for 3D Printers that can 
precisely measure the tilt of your print surface.It can greatly improve 
the printing precision of your 3D Printer.


Features simple,smart and precise.It could work with nearly any kind of bed materials,such as glasses, woods,metals and so on.


		 
	

The
 main functions and controls of 3D printer touch are the same as most 
auto bed leveling sensors, which consists of a RC servo and a micro 
switch,thus,3D printer touch can be used on almost every 3D printer 
control board.


By
 using progressively designed solenoid and hall sensor,It can integrate 
high precision in such a simple structure.To make it more user-friendly 
and to bring you more enjoyable printing experience we add many smart 
functions such as self-test,false alarm,alarm release and test mode for 
M119.


		 
	

Pulling/pushing hard on the push-pin can damage Touch sensorand make it less accurate.


Fix push-pin with locking paint after reassembling or adjusting core.
