Note before buying: 1. RD6018 series has two versions: RD6018 and  RD6018-W,RD6018-W have WIFI board , RD6018 don't have . RD6018-W can use WIFI board to connect APP, also use USB micro cable to connect PC solftware . RD6018 don't have WIFI board, only support PC software by connecting with USB micro cable, no support APP. For wifi board to connect PC software, now it did not support. Note: WiFi connection is a test function, due to poor compatibility of some computers, if you cannot connect PC software via WiFi, please ignore this function. For this function, we do not provide any guarantee and technical support,  and we will decide whether to keep this function based on customer feedback.2. For PC software, it only support win 7 and above for now. For APP, it only support android 5.0 and above. For APP and PC software, because there may be  incompatibilities problems, please download first before buying , if you can download and install, you can make order, or else stop buying. If you don't test the PC software and APP function before buying and find that the products works fine except the PC software or APP, we refuse to refund.3. For input AC-DC switch power supply, The input PSU we have is 800W, it is lower than the max output power of RD6018(1080W), if you need full output, please search for 65V 1200W power source, but 1200W PSU is large, it cannot be placed in the S800 case, so you need to make case by yourself4. There is a BACKUP fuse in the RD6018/RD6018W box, if you burn the fuse, you can insert the fuse in the socket next to the burned one for temporary use, but the fuse cannot support big currnet flow, so it is better to remove the damaged fuse and solder the good fuse on the same position5. If RD6018W can connect to the hotspot shared by the mobile phone but cannot connect to the router, you need to shut down the client isolation/ AP isolation and WMM function. 6. Please use the matching front-end power supply. (Product ID: 1750643) If the instrument is damaged due to the incorrect power supply, we will not provide after-sales guarantee.Technical parameters:
