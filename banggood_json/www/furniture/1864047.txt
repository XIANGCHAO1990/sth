This antique-style mango wooden 2-piece dining chair set will make an attention-grabbing addition to your dining room. Their steel frame makes the chairs considerably stable and sturdy. These classic-style chairs are made of solid mango wood, meaning that every piece of furniture is sui generis and slightly different from the next. Mango wood is solid, stable, durable, as well as glamorous. Signs of wear and visible grain structure endow each piece its own history and an exquisite look. The chair set is fully handmade and every step of the process is carried out with the great care. The open back design add to their spectacular retro style. Important note: colors vary from piece to piece, making each of our dining chairs unique.
