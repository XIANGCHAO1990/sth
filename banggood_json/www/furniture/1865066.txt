This wooden garden chair set consists of 8 pieces and is meant to be a great addition to your garden, terrace or patio. You can relax and chat with family and friends or enjoy the weather. Constructed from extremely durable teak hard wood, this piece of teak furniture has been seasoned, kiln dried and then fine sanded to give a very smooth appearance.

These outdoor chairs are also lightweight, making them completely flexible and easy to move around. The wooden chairs can be folded to save space when not in use.
