This wooden bar set in a retro look oozes industrial style and will make a striking addition to your decor. The bar table and chairs are made of solid reclaimed wood that has been sourced from joists, floors and support beams from old buildings being demolished, and can consist of different types of wood like pine, teak, beech, oak, cedar, mango wood, acacia, etc. This means the reclaimed wood retains the characteristics of these different types of wood. Reclaimed wood is already aged, weathered and dried, so it doesn't shrink or bend. The beautiful wood grains make every piece of furniture unique and slightly different from the next. Signs of wear and visible grain structure also give the set its own history and a unique look. Every step of the process is carried out with the great care, be it polishing, painting or lacquering. The steel frame ensures the set's sturdiness and stability but contributes to its industrial style as well. The footrests add to the seating comfort. Assembly is easy. Delivery includes 1 bar table and 6 bar chairs. Important note: Colours vary from piece to piece, making each of our items unique; the delivery is random.Material: Solid reclaimed wood + powder-coated steelTable dimensions: 59.1" x 27.6" x 42.1" (L x W x H)Chair dimensions: 17.7" x 14.2" x 39" (W x D x H)Seat width: 13.8"Seat depth: 11.8"Seat height from ground: 29.1"Polished, painted and lacqueredEasy to assembleDelivery includes 1 bar table and 6 bar chairs
