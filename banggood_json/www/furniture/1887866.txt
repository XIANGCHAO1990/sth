This rattan dining set has an elegant, contemporary design and will be a great choice for al fresco dining or relaxing in the garden. Made of weather-resistant and waterproof PE rattan, the dining set is easy to clean, hard-wearing and suitable for daily use. The powder-coated steel frames make the table and chairs strong and sturdy. The tabletopp and the armrests are made of solid acacia wood, a tropical hard wood, which is weather resistant.
