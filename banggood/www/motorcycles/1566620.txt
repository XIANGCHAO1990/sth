Fitment:

For oil, fuel, diesel, gas, air pressure (Cannot use measuring water pressure)

Can be used in oil tank, gas tank, diesel tank etc.

	 

Features:

It's an advance pressure transducer than traditional mechanical pressure transducer.

±2%FS small output error, including nonlinear, hysteresis error and repeatability, full temperature range.

It has complete surge voltage protection function.

Light weight and small size, convenient to install and operate.

	 

Package Included:1 X Pressure Transducer (With Cable)
