Note:Dear customers, this inverter has recently been upgraded to a brand customized pure sine wave inverter. In the future, we will pay more attention to the control of product quality and the sustainable development of the brand. At present, the appearance is different and the product quality is the same. Customers who have placed orders recently, you will receive one of the old and new packages randomly. Thanks for understanding and trust. Thanks for your continued support.Specifications:Type: Single Digital Display Solar inverterOutput voltage waveform: Pure sine wavePeak Power(Rated power): 3000W (1500W)Output voltage:AC 220V 240VInput voltage:12VOutput frequency:60HzLow-voltage protection: 9.5V/ 20VHigh-pressure protection:16V/30VConversion rate: 90% or more Features:- LCD display screen.- Buzzer reminder device. Once any protection of the inverter is triggered, the inverter immediately disconnects the power supply and the load enters a protection mode and reminds people through a buzzer reminder.- Double socket.- Up to 90% conversion rate.- Five intelligent protection, overload protection, high voltage protection, low voltage protection, over temperature protection, short circuit protection.- Intelligent temperature control fan, make the inverter more quiet. When the temperature ≤ 45 ℃, the fan stops working, when the temperature ≥ 45 ℃, the fan began to work.- Aluminum magnesiums alloy shell, light weight, good thermal conductivity, can quickly reduce the temperature of components, work long hours are not affected.New Featues:- Full bridge technology, also known as full bridge inverter, is the most stable and reliable design at present.- Dual control cooling mode of temperature control and power control.- Full time short-circuit protection function, whether it is full load, high temperature, short-circuit boot, boot short-circuit are safe protection.- Strong load capacity- The waveform is stable without burr.- The machine is equipped with adjustable buttons: output voltage, output frequency, convenient switching.- Highly integrated MCU control, more stable and reliablePackaged included:1 x Inverter1 x User manual1 x Ultra-thick battery cable (12V3000W )OR(2 x Ultra-thick battery cable  (48V3000W /60V3000W)Correct Connet Way:POSITIVE FROM THE BATTERY TO POSITIVE  OF INVERTER and  NEGATIVE FROM THE BATTERY TO NEGATIVE OF THE INVERTER!(+...connect...+,-...connect...-)
