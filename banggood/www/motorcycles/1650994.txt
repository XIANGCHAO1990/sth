Increase the intelligent human-machine information exchange display. Basically, the working status and various operating parameters of the inverter can be understood intuitively in the display, such as: input voltage, output voltage, output frequency, battery power, load wait.2.Fault prompt function. In addition to different audible prompts, it is more intuitively displayed on the display. For example, battery undervoltage, battery overvoltage, excessive load, high operating temperature, output short circuit, etc.3. The product has added the overload delay shutdown function. It solves the sensitive problem of inverter protection when the soluble appliances are started. For example, the user cannot afford a 50W LED lamp with a 300W traditional inverter or a 500W inverter.The transformer cannot afford a laptop and other issues.4. The low-power non-professional user market has added positive and negative connection return protection functions. It solves the problem of returning the user caused by artificially connecting the wrong wire and burning out the inverter, and solves your after-sales worry.5. Intelligent temperature-controlled oil-sealing fan. The inverter only works when it reaches a certain temperature, which is more energy-saving and quieter.6. Digital MCU control, precise, accurate, fast, intelligent; fine refers to the output wave shape, the frequency is more accurate. Quasi refers to the output voltage quasi; fast means the protection circuit responds quickly.Protection:Low-voltage alarm, low-voltage shutdown, low-voltage, over-voltage alarm, over-voltage shutdown, over-voltage, over-load shutdown, over-heat shutdown, reverse polarity protection, short-current protection.Package Included:1 XEP1500 Power Inverter 1 XBattery Cable1 XRemote Controller with 5m Cable1 X0.5m Ground Line1 XSmall Wrench1 XManual(English)More Details:
