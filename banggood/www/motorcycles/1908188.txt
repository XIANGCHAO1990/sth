Way of working:1. Circuit break protection: When the current reaches the cut-off value, the long handle automatically bounces and cuts off the power supply. Generally, it trips in a short-circuit condition. After the fault is eliminated, press the long handle back to the original position to form a path.2. Manually cut off the power: We need to disconnect the circuit when refitting, and directly press the oval red button on the insurance. At this time, the long handle automatically pops up to cut off the power. Connect as above, and then press the long handle back to its original position. Product currents: 40A 50A 60A 80A 100A 150A 200A 250A 300A Instructions:1) Wiring IN (BAT) incoming line, OUT (AUX) out line.2) Press the oval button, the long handle pops open, and the circuit breaker is cut off. (Be sure to press the elliptical button. If the power is cut off with the long handle directly, the circuit breaker will be broken and there is no warranty).3) After resetting the ejected long handle, the circuit breaker is energized. Package Included:1 X Circuit Breaker
