Create a compelling and cohesive aesthetic in your patio space with this patio dining set! The dinner table is made of solid acacia wood with an oil finish, which makes it stable, durable and easy to maintain. Featuring a powder-coated steel frame covered with weather-resistant PE rattan, these dining chairs are sturdy and easy to clean. The ergonomically-designed shape and thickly-padded cushions will provide the ultimate seating comfort. The low-maintenance polyester cushion covers can be easily removed and washed.
