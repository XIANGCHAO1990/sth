This patio dining set with an elegant design makes a great choice for dining or relaxing in the garden or on the patio! The outdoor furniture set features a sturdy powder-coated steel frame which makes it very stable and durable. Thanks to the weather-resistant PE rattan, the dining set is easy to clean, hardwearing as well as suitable for daily outdoor use. The glass tabletopp is also easy to clean with a damp cloth. Moreover, the included soft seat cushions also add the set's extra comfort. The low-maintenance polyester cushion covers can be easily removed and washed. Note: We recommend covering the set in the rain, snow and frost.Table:Color: Brown and transparentMaterial: PE rattan, glass, powder-coated steelDimensions: 78.7" x 39.4" x 29.1" (L x W x H)Chair:Color: BrownCushion color: Dark grayMaterial: PE rattan, powder-coated steel, solid acacia woodCushion material: 100% polyesterDimensions: 22" x 23.6" x 32.3" (W x D x H)Seat width: 16.1"Seat depth: 17.7"Seat height from the ground (without cushion): 16.1"Armrest height from the ground: 24"Assembly required: YesDelivery contains:1 x Table8 x Chair8 x Seat cushion
