Create a compelling and cohesive aesthetic in your outdoor space with this garden dining set! The dinner table is made of solid acacia wood with an oil finish, which makes it stable, durable and easy to maintain. Featuring a powder-coated steel frame covered with weather-resistant PE rattan, these dining chairs are sturdy and easy to clean. The backrest will recline by pulling the button on the side. Thanks to the lightweight construction, the chairs are easy to move. It is also delivered with highly comfortable, thickly-padded cushions for the ultimate comfort. The low-maintenance polyester covers can also be removed and washed. Important note: We recommend covering the dining set during rain, snow and frost for its best service to last.Table:Material: Solid acacia wood with an oil finishDimensions: 59.1" x 35.4" x 29.1" (L x W x H)Chair:Color: GrayColor of cushion: Dark grayMaterial: PE (polyethylene) rattan, powder-coated steelCushion cover material: 100 % polyesterCushion thickness: 1.6"Dimensions (not reclined): 22.4" x 28.7" x 41.3" (W x D x H)Dimensions (reclined): 22.4" x 50" x 38.2" (W x D x H)Seat width: 18.5"Seat depth: 20.9"Seat height from the ground without cushion: 16.1"Armrest height from the ground: 24.8"Assembly required: YesDelivery contains:1 x Table6 x Chair6 x Seat cushion6 x Back cushion
