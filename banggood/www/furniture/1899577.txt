This garden lounge set offers a generous seating area and also remains modern with a touch of class for your garden or patio. Thanks to the water-resistant PE rattan, the sofa set is easy to clean, hard-wearing and suitable for daily outdoor use. It is delivered with thickly padded seat cushions and back pillows for the ultimate support, making it as comfortable as indoor sofa set. The low-maintenance polyester cover can also be removed and washed. The lounge set offers total flexibility and can be easily moved to suit any settings. Note: We recommend covering the set during rain, snow and frost.Color: GrayMaterial: PE rattan, powder-coated steel, glassCushion & pillow cover material: 100% polyesterCorner sofa:Dimensions: 28.3" x 28.3" x 24.8" (W x D x H)Seat width: 24.4"Seat depth: 24.4"Seat height from the ground without cushion: 13"Middle sofa:Dimensions: 26.8" x 28.3" x 24.8"(W x D x H)Seat width: 26.8"Seat depth: 24.4"Seat height from the ground without cushion: 13"Coffee table dimensions: 24.4" x 24.4" x 13" (L x W x H)Cushion thickness: 2.4"Pillow thickness: 5.9"Delivery contains:4 x Corner sofa2 x Middle sofa1 x Coffee table6 x Seat cushion8 x Back pillow
