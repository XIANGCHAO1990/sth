Features:

The MUSTOOL MT525 can test electric field radiation and magnetic field emission to r'each the optimal test result. It's widely used to test and learn electromagnetic radiation situation indoor and outdoor:
►Electromagnetic radiation monitoring: Household and appartment, office, outdoor and industrial site;
►Electromagnetic radiation test: Mobile phone, computer, TV set, refrigerator and high voltage cable radiation test;
►Radiation protection product test: Test effects of radition-proof clothes, radiation-proof film and other prevention articles.
Equipped with a built-in electromagnetic radiation sensor, which can display the radiation value on the clear LCD digital display after processing by control micro-chip.

One instrument with two uses,it can test the electric field and the magnetic field radiation at the same time;
Sound-light alarm,when the test result exceeds the safe value,the instrument will alarm automatically;
Data locking,one-key lock of the radiation value;
LCD graphic display of the radiation value trend;
Radiation assessment,remind you whether the radiation value is safe or not; Fashionable design,easy on-hand operation, it is easy to move or make field measurement.
