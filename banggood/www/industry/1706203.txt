Specification:Controller: STM32 V3.1STemperature: 50-480℃Max Power: 120WDisplay: 1.3inchBattery: 3VTin Lelting Time: <8sBattery： 3VCase Material: Aluminum AlloySize:   88 x 40 x 38mmNote:The tip is not continuously working at high temperature, which is easy to damage the tip!The melting point of common solder is 183℃, the melting point of lead-free solder is 227℃, and the general welding temperature is 300-380 ℃.380°C is the boundary of temperature. When the temperature is higher than 380°C, the iron head will oxidize and lose rapidly, which will seriously affect the life of heating coreThe temperature display above 380 ° C will jump, the higher the temperature, the greater the jump!It is recommended to carry out welding at 300-380℃, most of the work can be carried out, and the temperature beating is normal, which will not affect the use!The soldering iron used in this welding station is a brand new soldering iron head. Because the resistance of the new iron head is not stable, the temperature will jump or error, which is a normal phenomenon. After multiple use, the stability will gradually stabilize. Package Included:1 x KSGER Mini T12 STM32 V3.1S Welding Soldering Station1 x Handle1 x T12-K Soldering Tip1 x T12-BC2 Soldering TipDetail Pictures:
