※Descriptions:

	 

MDP (Mini Digital Power System) is a system of programmable linear DC power supply based on modular design, capable of connecting different modules for use as needed.

Current Functional Modules:Display Control Module,Digital Power Module

Modules in Develop:Digital Signal Genetator Module,Electronic Load Module,Power Charger Module,Battery Pack Module

	 

MDP-XP consists of a display control module and a digital power module. Through 2.4G wireless connection, it achieves multichannel free combination at the power of 90W per channel. MDP-XP is a high cost-effective programmable linear DC power supply, featuring indicators, stability, reliability and distinct user interface comparable with professional power supplies; it also provides programmable output, timing output, sequential control, automatic compensation and other powerful functions, so as to meet diversified testing needs.

	 

Display Control Module: equipped with a 2.8-inch TFT screen, it can display the voltage-current waveform in real time, support data statistics, and automatically pair with and control six sub-modules (digital power modules), with dual thumb wheels and 90-degree scrolling user-friendly design.

Digital Power Module: high efficiency linear output, 0.25mV ripple wave, high-speed transient response, and supporting precise fine-tuning.

※Features:
	 

- 2.4G wireless connection, supporting a Display Control as well as six Digital Powers

- DC wide voltage input between 4.2V and 30V, reduced up to 2.7V after startup

- High-speed transient response and over current protection, as fast as 4uS

- Extremely low load regulation and intelligent line loss compensation

- High efficiency and natural heat dissipation with 90W of capacity load

- Support positive & negative pressure, series pressurization, parallel current sharing, free combination of collaborative load, and intelligent power allocation

- Security Protections: input overvoltage, under-voltage protection, anti-reverse connection protection, anti-backflow protection, overtemperature protection, and over current protection
