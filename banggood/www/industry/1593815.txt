Why buy YH LCD digital readout systems?
	Large LCD Display

		1.Systems increase productivity, save time and provide higher precision by translating the values measured by linear encoders, length gauges, rotary encoders or angle encoders into an easy-to-read format.

		2.They can be installed on new equipment or retrofitted to machines already in operation.

		3.Systems work with any machine where axis slides are traversed manually.

		4.Data interface allows for additional processing or printouts of the measured values (most models).

		 

		Why buy 5u KA300 Linear Encoders?(Dust-proof, IP54 waterproof designHigh quality bearing, reliable and durable)

		1.Eliminate machine tool position errors caused by thermal expansion, deformation of the drive mechanics, pitch issues and more.

		2.High long-term speed stability.

		3.Sturdy construction and high resistance to vibration.

		4.Finer signal periods offer highest interpolation accuracy.

		5.Compact, lightweight and easy to install.

		6.Durable and dependable—functions properly even after many years of operation.
		7.Sealed or enclosed linear designs available.
