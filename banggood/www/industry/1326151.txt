NOTE: 


Iron tip do not work high temperature continuously, the tips will be damage easier.

Solder melting point is 183°C, lead-free solder melting point is 227°C, the welding temperature is 300-380°C.
			380°C is the temperature of the dividing line.
			When the temperature is higher than 380°C, iron head oxidation and loss is fast, affect the life of heating core.

Higer than 380°C, temperature display also will be beating, the higher the temperature, the greater the beating!
			Recommended in the 300-380°C for welding work, most of the work can be carried out, the temperature beating is normal.
