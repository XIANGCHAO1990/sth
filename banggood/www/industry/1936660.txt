Description:﻿Intelligent temperature control cooling fan automatically starts coolingStart cooling when the temperature is greater than 45°C or the output power is greater than 30%Less than 40°C or output power less than 25% stop workingHigh voltage protection, battery protection,Overload protection, short circuit protectionLow voltage protection, high temperature protectionLeakage protection, surge protectionreverse polarity protection, shock protectionElectrical protection, over-current protectionAdvantages of pure sine wave inverters：The output of the pure sine wave inverter is the same as the grid we use every dayLike or even better sine wave alternating current, there is no electromagnetic in the gridPollution, in simple terms, is a wide range of applications, strong load capacity, and stability.It has excellent performance and can provide the same alternating current as the normal household. in satisfyingIt can drive almost any kind of electrical appliances under the condition of high speed.(such as household air conditioners, refrigerators, soymilk machines, and other inductive load appliances)Specification: 4000w ：Size 29.5x16.5x8cmOutput waveformpure sine waveThe output voltage220VOutput frequency50HzConversion efficiency> 90%Input voltage12V/24V/48VPeak power5000WRated power2300W5000w Size 33.5x16.5x8cmoutput waveformpure sine waveThe output voltage220VOutput frequency50HzConversion efficiency> 90%Input voltage12V/24V/48VPeak power5000WRated power2300W6000w Size 35.5x21.5x8cm Output waveformpure sine waveThe output voltage220VOutput frequency50HzConversion efficiency> 90%Input voltage12V/24V/48VPeak power6000WRated power2800W7000w Size 46.5x21.5x8cm Output waveformpure sine waveThe output voltage220VOutput frequency50HzConversion efficiency> 90%Input voltage12V/24V/48VPeak power7000WRated power3500Wnote :The inverter voltage must be the same as the battery voltage. For example, a 48V inverter can only be used with a 48V battery.Package Included:
