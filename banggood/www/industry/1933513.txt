Test video:https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Tv411G7npGroup:https://groups.io/g/usdx-users/Some reference links：SoftwareHardware 1Hardware 2Hardware 3Groupit is optimized fromuSDX QCX-SSB open source hardware. The powerful software supports the use of less hardware to complete the SW transceiver and supports the SSB mode (reception quality is very good, transmission quality is slightly worse). In addition, the developer also developed an AM/FM mode for it, but AM/FM is defined as a gift function. Don't expect AM/FM too high.Description:This is a shortwave QRP SSB/CW transceiver. Ultra-small size is easy to carry to outdoor use, using 1602N LCD displayscreen, built-in speaker, support to connect to PC, use FT8, JS8, FT4 and other digital mode software control, support CW automatic decoding.Features:8 bands covering 80m/60m/40m/30m/20m/17m/15m/10m.Excellent PCB layout design that conforms to high-frequency circuit design principles to ensure excellent performance.It can reach 3-5W power in 8 bands, and reserve SOT-223 and TO-220 package pads for upgradesHigh emission efficiency, 80m/60m/40m/30m/20m efficiency is higher than 80%, 17m efficiency is higher than 70%, 15m/10m efficiency is higher than 60%High-precision KDS brand TCXO, frequency accuracy better than 1PPM, frequency stability better than 0.5PPMUltra-small size: 83*38*124mm (excluding protruding parts)Abundant interfaces (CAT, PTT OUT, MIC/KEY, K-head microphone)All LPF parts use 100V C0G/NP0 capacitorsUse original genuine Omron magnetic latching relayUse a lower noise op amp chip than the LM4562Built-in speaker with cavityBNC Antenna InterfaceSpecification:Type: HF QRP SDR TransceiverMode: SSB/CWRF output: 10W max at 13.8V exit DC inFrequency range: 3.5-30MHzBuilt-in MicrophoneAntenna/connector: 50ohms/SO-239 Shell size: length 12.4cm x width 8.7cm x height 3.7cm (excluding protruding parts)Packing weight: 550gPacking size: 18 x 12 x 8cmFunction:1. Simple, interesting and versatile QRP SSB HF transceiver with embedded DSP and SDR functions;2. EER Class-E drives SSB transmission class3. Use 13.8V power supply to output about 5W PEP SSB4. Full mode support: USB, LSB, CW, AM, FM (SSB mode has good receiving effect, but poor transmitting effect. AM and FM mode are gift power, poor effect)5. DSP filters: 4000, 2500, 1700, 500, 200, 100, 50 Hz passband6. DSP functions: Automatic Gain Control (AGC), Noise Reduction (NR), Voice Trigger Xmit, RX Attenuator (ATT), TX Noise Gate, TX Drive control, volume control, dBm/S meter.7. SSB to sideband/carrier suppression transmit: better than -45dBc, IMD3 (dual tone) -33dBc, receive: better than -50dBc8. Multi-band support, continuously adjustable through 80m-10m frequency band (starting from 20kHz~99MHz, performance loss)9. Open source firmware, built with Arduin0 IDE; allows experimentation, new features can be added, contributions can be shared via Github, software complexity: 2000 lines of code10. Software based Voice Trigger Xmit can be used as fast full control (QSK and half QSK operation) or auxiliary RX/TX switching to operate digital mode (no need CAT or PTT interface), external PTT output/PA control with TX-delay11. Simple installation modification with 8 component changes and 8 wires12. Lightweight and Low-Cost Transceiver Design: High energy efficiency due to EER transmitter class E (no need for bulky heat sinks), and and simple design (no need for complex balanced linear power amplifiers)13. All-digital and software-based SSB transmitter stage: by controlling the phase of the SI5351 PLL (via a small frequency change on 800kbits/s I2C) and amplitude of PA (via PWM PA key shaping circuit)14. All-digital and software-based SDR receiver stage (optional): Sample I/Q (complex) signal from quadrature sampling tester digital mixer and mathematically perform a 90-degree phase shift (Hilbert transform) in the piece and cancel one by adding sidebands15. Three independent switchable analog front end receiver attenuators (0dB, -13dB, -20dB, -33dB, -53dB, -60dB, -73dB)16. Receiver noise floor MDS: –135 dBm at 28MHz (200Hz BW)17. Receiver front-end selectivity: +/-2kHz steep -45dB/decade roll-off from tuned frequency18. Blocking dynamic range: 20kHz offseit 123dB, 2kHz offseit 78dB19. CW Decoder, Straight/Iambic-A/B Keyer20. VFO A/B + RIT and Split, and corresponding relays via I2C with filter switching21. CAT support (using TS-480 protocol)Package included:1 x Transceiver(not included battery)1 x Microphone1 x Charger (EU/US plug)4 x Machine Feet
