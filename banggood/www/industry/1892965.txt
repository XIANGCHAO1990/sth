It is an adjustable angle digital microscope that solves the problem of light reflection. It can effectively reduce the reflection of metal objects and clearly display the details of the components.Advantage 2:This is a continuous zoom digital microscope, it has a true 300X optical magnification effect (150x microscope lens, 2X objective lens), digital magnification up to 2100x times. With 26MP high-definition resolution, it can meet your various needsFeatures:- Equipped with 26 million pixel CMOS image sensor, HDMI 1080P 60 frames per second high-definition image output, no delay and no smear (compared to other microscopes on the market, most of them are 30 frames)- When the HDR Mode is turned on, it has a strong light suppression function, which can well solve the reflection phenomenon of metal objects, so as not to hurt the eyes and get more object details- Continuous zoom, can simultaneously support USB computer and display screen effect real-time display, support computer software measurement function.- This microscope is more extensible: C-mount (25mm) is used. Real lens optical magnification: 300X ,digital magnification 2100X. C-mount lenses of other magnifications can be replaced at will (if you need other styles of lenses, please contact customer service )- Multiple system, support Windows XP/7/8/10 system.
