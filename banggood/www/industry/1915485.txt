The higher the frequency, the more the decrease is, and the highest frequency may be lower than 2W.Battery powered:Overall power reduced by one-thirdAM and FM functions are gifts, not guaranteed to be perfectFeatures:1. Using IRF series launch tube, durable.2. Can be used to connect the antenna (meter base).3. Aluminum laser shell marking, all aluminum buttons, translucent silicone keys.4. The original qcx circuit is greatly simplified, and the installed components are reduced by 50%. There is no need for complicated transformer windings, and no wiring procedures, the most cost-effective and easy to construct.Function List: -Eer e-level drive ssb launch stage-13.8v power source about 10w ssb pep output-Full mode support: usb, lsb, cw, am, fm-dsp filter: 4000, 2500, 1700, 500, 200, 100, 50hz passband-dsp function: control automatic gain (agc), noise reduction (nr), voice trigger, voice trigger xmit , attenuator rx (att), tx noise gate, tx driver control, volume control, dbm/s-meter-Ssb reverse sideband/carrier suppression transmission: better than -45dbc, imd3 (dual tone) -33dbc, reception: better than -50dbc -Multi-band support, continuously adjustable in the 160m-10m frequency range (with loss of 20khz performance ) ..99mhz)-Open source firmware, built into ide; allows experimentation, can add new features, can share contributions through github, software complexity: 2000 lines of code-V-based software can be used for fast complete rogue operations (qsk and semi-qsk), or auxiliary execution in digital mode (without cat or ptt interface) for rx/tx switch, with tx/pa delay control External ptt output-Simple installation and modification, 8 component changes and 8 wires-Lightweight, low-cost transceiver: Thanks to the eer electronic level transmitter, it has high power efficiency (no need for bulky heat sink) and simple design (no need for complex balanced linear power amplifiers)-Ssb transmitter phase based entirely on digital and software: control the phase of the si5351 pll (via a small i2c frequency change exceeding 800kbit/s) and the amplitude of the pa (via from pwm to pwm) to test the microphone input and reconstruct the ssb signal. Key shaping circuit pa)-All-digital and software-based sdr receiver stage (optional): sample the i/q signal (complex) from the quadrature sampling tester digital mixer, and perform a 90-degree phase shift (Hilber transform) in software And remove a sideband by adding-Three switchable analog faders independent of the front receiver (0db, -13db, -20db, -33db, -53db, -60db, -73db)-Mds receiver noise level: -135dbm (200hz bw) at 28mhz-Front receiver selectivity: steep frequency adjustment -45db/ten times roll-off +/- 2khz -blockingDynamic range: 20khz offseit 123db, 2khz offseit 78db-Cw decoder, straight / iambic-a /b keying -Vfo a/b + rit and frequency division, and switch the corresponding relay with filter through i2c-Cat support (TS480 subset), can stream audio, keystrokes and display text via catPort Introduction:-Charging: Built-in-In the lithium battery charging port, only the included charger can be used! It is forbidden to use other chargers!-Switch: off, Bat: built-in battery power supply, 13.8: external power supply-DC13.8v/3a: external power supplyInterface -Key: automatic key body connection (a, b, single key)-Pa: external power amplifier, ptt signal-Mic: External microphoneInterface -Uart: serial communication (TS-480 compatible command)-Spk: external speakersPackage Included:1 x Transceiver Group1 x Walkie Talkie （Optional）NOTE：The new/old version is shipped randomly, they have the same function, only the appearance is different
