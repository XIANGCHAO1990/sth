Tips:

1.The Junction Box is mounted on the Back! So it`s not suitable to be glued on the roof of the vehicle.

2.DO NOT have the positive and negative anodes of the allig  ator clip to touch or connect to each other, or it will cause short circuit and burning.

3.Don`t bend it over 10° though it`s flexible coz it`s small size!

4.Don`t place the junction box side under heavy rain coz it`s only IP65 waterproof!
