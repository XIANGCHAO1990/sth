The 40112302 dial test indicator is designed for taking measurements in machining, layout, and inspection work.
Has microfine black graduations for 0-40-0 balanced inch readings and red graduations for 0.001mm balanced metric readings.
A movement and an auto-reversing contact point provide smooth action.
A knurled bezel rotates 360 degrees to zero the reading at any location.
Three dovetail mounts on the top, back, and front of the indicator provide a range of mounting options.
The one-piece housing and satin chrome finish provides durability.

The 40112302 inch/metric dial test indicator includes one 3/8" and one 5/32" dovetail clamp and a molded case.
Dial readings with three digits, 0-40-0 for example, signify that the indicator has a balanced dial.
Dial readings with two digits, 0-100 for example, indicate the dial has a continuous dial.
Balanced dials are used for reading the difference from a specific surface reference point.
Continuous dials are used for direct readings and usually have a larger measurement range than balanced dials.
