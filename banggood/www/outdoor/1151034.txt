Attention:
	1. The fabric of lazy soft is updated into 210D oxford cloth, waterproof and anti-tearing.
2. Please pay more attention that you have to try your best to get more air in the sofa.
	Then you must roll up the folding for 3-4 times until it is full of air enough. Fasten it tightly, otherwise, it will leak air quickly.
