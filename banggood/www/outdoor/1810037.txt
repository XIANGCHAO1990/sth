The charging port is rotated to open, and cannot be pulled;2. Regarding the battery protection mechanism: it is recommended not to accelerate too fast when using it, it is easy to cause the battery protection mechanism to stop (not work), and it needs to be recharged before it can be used.3. You can lift the speed limit. When the power is on, press and hold the right brake and accelerator handle at the same time, and the speed limit can be lifted when you hear a "beep" sound. Likewise, you can set a speed limit.Have a wonderful day!
