It's lightweight, fast, and well suited to leisure SUP activities like cruising on a quiet lake, ocean, or down a calm river.It’s super compact when deflated and packed inside a backpack, very easy to store and transport.The soft, durable and non-slip EVA deck pad is able to resist damage from exposure to seawater and direct sunlight.Superb maneuverability ensures that paddlers of all skill levels can have fun with the sport.The wide deck of the board provides great stability to help you balance on the board easily.This package includes:1 x 10'6'' Board1 x Aluminum Paddle1 x Carry Backpack1 x Safety Leash1 x  Hand Pump1 x Slide-in Center FinQ&A: -What is the difference between the two models, the Rainbow R and the Sailor? Specs are almost the same.-The net weight of the Sailor is 9.3kg, which is ultra-lightweight by inflatable SUP standards, while the Rainbow R    weights 10.3kg.
Thanks to the light weight, Sailor is able to surpass Rainbow R in terms of speed and transportability and is more suitable for ladies and kids.
But Rainbow R is more stable and stronger than Sailor.
If you only use an Inflatable SUP board for flat water paddling or other recreational purposes, Sailor would do just fine.
The Rainbow R is more versatile so if you want to challenge yourself to more complicated usages of the board like SUP yoga, whitewater paddling or SUP fishing, the Rainbow R might be the better choice here.
