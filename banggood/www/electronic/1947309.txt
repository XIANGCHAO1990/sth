Notice:1. This product requires soldering.2. The case needs to be purchased separately.3. Please confirm that the separate shell option or DIY kit option has been selected before purchasing, the price difference is large, so as to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.Documents: (Click to open)User Manual (Rev.00)Assembly Guide (Rev.00)Schematic (main board)Schematic (Analog board)Introduction:M162 LCR meter is a great complimentary tool to most multi-meters. Regular multi-meters are good in many way. But they usually have rather limited or even no ability for capacitance, inductance, and sub-ohm resistance measurement. The addition of a M162 LCR meter will overcome this deficiency. The DIY kit version of M162 is very easy to build. No special calibration is required to achieve ~1% accuracy.Highlights of M162 LCR Meter:Resistance range: 0.1ohm — 20M ohmCapacitance range: 1pF — 20mFInductance range: 1uH — 20KHFully automatic rangingAccuracy: about 1%Built-in virtual USB comport for data output and firmware upgradeSerial data output via USB comport or direct LVTTLDisplay HOLD functionUSB/Battery poweredEasy to build, easy to useOptional acrylic enclosure (sold separately)Specifications:Display:Primary: R, C, LSecondary: Q, D, ESREquivalent Circuit Mode: Parallel or SerialPrimitive Data: |Z| and Θ, or Rs and XsMeasurement Range and Accuracy:R, |Z|: 0.1Ω - 20MΩC: 1pF - 20000μFL: 1μH - 20000HQ, D: 0 - 10000Θ: -90° - 90°Accuracy: About 1% (tested for resistance 1Ω - 1MΩ)Measurement Conditions:Test Frequency: 100Hz, 1KHzOpen Voltage: 0.5VppMiscellaneous:Measurement Connections: 4 Kelvin wires on the test terminalsRanging: Fully automaticCompensations: Open, ShortSerial Data Output: YesPower Supply: USB or batteryPower Consumption: < 100mA @ 5VDimensions: 111 x 76 x 25 mm (4.37" x 3.0" x 1.0")Weight: 100gPackage includes:1 x DIY M162 kit (optional)1 x Shell only (optional)
