Note before buying:1. RD6024 series has two versions:RD6024 and RD6024-W,RD6024-W have WIFI board , RD6024 don't have . RD6024-W can use WIFI board to connect APP, also use USB micro cable to connect PC solftware . RD6018 don't have WIFI board, only support PC software by connecting with USB micro cable, no support APP. For wifi board to connect PC software, now it did not support.Note: WiFi connection is a test function, due to poor compatibility of some computers, if you cannot connect PC software via WiFi, please ignore this function. Forthis function, we do not provide any guarantee and technical support,  and we will decide whether to keep this function based on customer feedback.2. For PC software, it only support win 7 and above for now. For APP, it only support android 5.0 and above.For APP and PC software, because there may be  incompatibilities problems, please download first before buying , if you can download and install, you can make order, or else stop buying. If you don't test the PC software and APP function before buying and find that the products works fine except the PC software or APP, we refuse to refund.3. If you connect inductive load (such as motor), the max working current is 1/3 of range. don't exceed it.4. When get the PSU, please use multimeter to check if the real output voltage is stable and fits the rated voltage, to see if it is damaged on the way, if the output is abnormal, please contact us, do not connect it to RD power supply to avoid more loss5. There may be scratches on the surface but it doesn't affect the product performance, please do not be over picky, and if you do mind this, please do not buy this product6. You can only connect the cables with a foundation in electronic and electrical engineering and it must be reliably grounded!7. Due to express delivery, some power supply warranty labels may be damaged, which does not affect product warranty!8. Due to the different power supply production batches, the internal material details may be different, hereby explain!9. There is a BACKUP fusein the RD6024/RD6024W box, if you burn the fuse, you can insert the fuse in the socket next to the burned one for temporary use and it supports only 10A, so it is better to remove the damaged fuse and solder the good fuse on the same position for full output.10. When intall our switching power supply into our case, please follow our instruction to assemble, do not remove the shell of the PSU to use. After the shell of the switching power supply is removed, the structural change of the heat dissipation system will lead to insufficient heat dissipation,and some components will be overheated and damaged, in this case we don't offer after sell serviceFriendly reminder:1. If you do not order the whole set, the device can only be powered with DC input, no AC input. You need to use switching power supply for AC input, and it must be grounded, otherwise there is a risk of leakage2. Recommend PSU:It is recommended to use our custom PSU or famous brand PSU!3. Not recommended PSU:If you use AC-DC converter or transformer to power on RD power supply, you must add rectifier and filter, DC output voltage without load should be lower than 65V，power grid voltage fluctuation will cause the high output voltage and burn the device!4. Banned PSU:Forbid using electric bike charger, second-hand power supply, modified power supply, especially the PSU that claims to be suitable for RD power supply but we have not recommended ......These devices output are extremely unstable and may output high voltages and burn your load!(bad PSU will have peak overvoltage)Instruction video for manual:a.
