Description:   This is  compatible R3 Mega2560 ATmega2560-16AU control board without USB cable and unsolder Pin header.   Mega is an ATmega2560 as core microcontroller development board itself has 54 groups digital I / O input / output terminal  (14 groups do PWM outputs), 16 sets of simulation than the input side, group 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports),  using the 16 MHz crystal oscillator. With the bootloader, download the program directly via USB without having to  go through other external writer. Supply part of the optional USB power, or as an external power using the AC-to-DC adapter and battery.  Rapid growth due to open the original code, as well as the concept of using Java (cross-platform) C language  development environment for  peripheral module. The main reason attracted Artist  can quickly  use the  language with Flash or Processing ... software communication, to make multimedia interactive works.   development IDE interface is based on open-source principles, allows you to free download for use in project work,  school teaching, motor control, interactive works.  Power supply design  There are two options for the power supply system of the  Mega USB direct power supply or external power supply.  The choice of power supply will be switched automatically. External supply AC-to-DC adapter or the battery can be selected  on this control panel. Limit the voltage range of 6V ~~ 12V, but if the voltage supplied is less than 6V, I / O port may not be  supplied to a voltage of 5V, and therefore instability; If the voltage is greater than 12V, the regulator device may possibly  overheating protection, are more likely to damage the  MEGA. Therefore recommended operating supply 6.5 ~ 12V,  the recommended power supply to 7.5V or 9V.  The development board have been rigorously tested each product at the factory before to burn a Blink small program,  please get the goods energized inspection under the L lamp will be lit for 3 seconds and then off for 1 second,  non-stop cycle to Detection of the board is good or bad.  Its chip is  original.  Specification:   Microcontroller: ATmega2560  Operating voltage: 5V  Input voltage (recommended): 7-12V  Input voltage (limits): 6-20V  Digital I / O pins: 54 (of which 14 provide PWM output)  Analog input pins: 16  DC current per I / O pin: 40 mA  DC current for 3.3V Pin: 50 mA  Flash Memory: 256 KB of which 4 KB used by bootloader  SRAM: 8 KB  EEPROM: 4 KB  Clock Speed: 16MHz  Package included:   1 x  Mega 2560 R3 ATmega2560-16AU Development Board
