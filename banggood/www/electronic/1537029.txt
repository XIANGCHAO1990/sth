Description:

	Kit Name: ICL7107 Voltmeter DIY Kit

PCB size: 70.6*39mm

Head mounting opening size: 77*40mm

Display window size: 51*24mm

Soldering manual: Click here.

Electrical parameters:
	 

Working voltage: DC5V

Working current: 35mA

Measurement accuracy: It can be calibrated to get higher precision and no parameters at present.

Measuring range: divided into 3 files, 0-2V file Measuring small voltage

                                                            0-20V file measuring low voltage

                                                            0-200V, measuring higher voltage.

Range selection method: solder joints with gear selection on the board,

When the two points of the 0-2V file are soldered together, and the resistance of the RX soldering resistor is 1K, the measurement range is 0-2V;

When soldering 2 points of 0-20V file together, the RX soldering resistance is 100K, the measuring range is 0-20V;

When soldering 2 points of 0-200V file together, the RX soldering resistance is 1M, the measurement range is 0-200V;

Overrange display: first position shows 1 or -1

In the kit, the RX is available in 100K and 1M, and the buyer selects the soldering according to his measurement range. This voltmeter can also be changed into an ammeter. The method of changing the current meter: the PCB reserve a 2W 0.1 ohm high-precision resistance soldering position on the board, solder this resistance, and then RX does not need to be soldered. This is a 0-2A ammeter.

Display color: red

Tools needed to make the production: multimeters, electric irons, and water pliers are needed.
