Note before buying:NOTE for Switching power supply: When get the PSU, please use multimeter to check if the real output voltage is stable and fits the rated voltage, to see if it is damaged on the way, if the output is abnormal, please contact us, do not connect it to RD power supply to avoid more loss1. RD6012P series has two versions:RD6012P and RD6012P-W,RD6012P-W have WIFI board , RD6012P don't have . RD6012P-W can use WIFI board to connect APP, also use USB micro cable to connect PC solftware . RD6012P don't have WIFI board, only support PC software by connecting with USB micro cable, no support APP. For wifi board to connect PC software, now it did not support.Note: WiFi connection is a test function, due to poor compatibility of some computers, if you cannot connect PC software via WiFi, please ignore this function. Forthis function, we do not provide any guarantee and technical support,  and we will decide whether to keep this function based on customer feedback.2. for PC software, it only support win 7 and above for now. For APP, it only support android 5.0 and above.For APP and PC software, because there may be  incompatibilities problems, please download first before buying , if you can download and install, you can make order, or else stop buying. If you don't test the PC software and APP function before buying and find that the products works fine except the PC software or APP, we refuse to refund.3. if you connect inductive load (such as motor), the max working current is 1/3 of range. don't exceed it.Package includes:1 x RD6012P Power supply onlywifi board (optional)All RD6012P/RD6012PW instruction and case installation instruction download Link:1.

Supported power supply: >>>Purchase link, click here (Product ID 1916902) to buy<<<For input AC-DC switch power supply, we recommend 800W switch power supply (S800 case leave fix hole size for this version),you can see more parameters about the800W switch power supply6. Friendly reminder:-There may behigh-frequency noise when the 800W 65V switch power supply is powered on and there is no load, which can be improved by adding a load resistoras shown in the figure! But for some people, they can still hear the noise, if you mind the noise, please do not buy this power supply, 800W 68V version does not need it-You can only connect the cables with a foundation in electronic and electrical engineering and it must be reliably grounded!-Due to express delivery, some power supply warranty labels may be damaged, which does not affect product warranty!-Due to the different power supply production batches, the internal material details may be different, hereby explain!7. There is a BACKUP fuse in the RD6012P/RD6012PW box, if you burn the fuse, you can insert the fuse in the socket next to the burned one for temporary use, but the socket can only support under 10A for short time usage, so it is better to remove the damaged fuse and solder the good fuse on the same position8. When intall our 800W PSU into our case, please follow our instruction to assemble, do not remove the shell of the PSU to use. After the shell of the switching power supply is removed, the structural change of the heat dissipation system will lead to insufficient heat dissipation,and some components will be overheated and damaged, in this case we don't offer after sell serviceTechnical parameters:ModelRD6006(W)RD6012(W)RD6018(W)RD6006P(W)RD6012P(W)Input voltage range6-70.00V7-70.00VOutput voltage range0-60VOutput current range0-6.000A0-12.00A0-18.00A0-6.0000A0-12.000A/0-6.0000AOutput power range0-360W0-720W0-1080W0-360W0-720WInput voltage measurement resolution0.01VOutput voltage setting measurement resolution0.01V0.001VOutput current setting measurement resolution0.001A0.01A0.0001A0.001A/0.0001ABattery voltage measurement resolution0.01VInput voltage measurement accuracy±(1%+5 digits)Output voltage accuracybetween setting and measurement±(0.3%+3 digits)±(0.5‰+4digits)Output current accuracy between setting and measurement±(0.5%+5 digits)±(1‰+6digits)Battery voltage measurement accuracy±(0.5%+3 digits)Automatic cut off currentvaluewhen charging10mA100mASet by yourselfOutput ripple typical100mV VPP250mV VPP@6A20mV VPP ①Working temperature range-10℃~40℃External sensor Temperature detection range-10℃~100℃/0℉~200℉External sensor Temperature detection accuracy:±3℃/±6℉Constant voltage moderesponse time2ms（0.1A-5Aload）Constant voltage mode load regulation±(0.1%+2 digits)Constant current mode load regulation±(0.1%+3digits)Capacity measurement range0-9999.99AhEnergy measurement range0-9999.99WhCapacity and energy statistical error±2％BuckworkingmodeVoltage drop>1Vand>10%(input voltage÷1.1) -2 ②Cooling fan start conditionOutput voltage>40V or Output current>4A orSystem temperature>45℃Output current>8A orSystem temperature>45℃Output current >4A or System temperature>45℃Output current>4A orSystem temperature>50℃Cooling fan shut down condition when workingOutput voltage<40V & Output current<3.9A & System temperature<45℃Output current<7.9A & System temperature<45℃Output current <3.9A and System temperature <45℃Output current <3.9A and System temperature <50℃Over temperature protectionSystem temperature >80℃Screen brightness setting0-5(6 level in total)Screen2.4inch color HD displayWeight(with package)About 0.58kgAbout 0.61kgAbout 0.68kgAbout 0.62kgAbout 0.66KgProduct dimension167*81*65mm167*81*69mm167*81*65mmSupport USB communicationYesSupport WiFi communicationOnly for RD60XX-W version①:Ripple measurement method:  noise and ripple are measured at X1 range, AC coupling, 20MHz of bandwidth on your oscilloscope with a 0.1uF parallel capacitor at the output terminals②for example: input voltage is 24V，the max output voltage is 19.8V.
