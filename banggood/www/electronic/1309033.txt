*Note: Joint product & Provided by Banggood and Newchic.    This capacitive soil moisture sensor is distinguished from most resistive sensors on the market and uses capacitive sensing to detect soil moisture. The problem that the resistance sensor is easily corroded is avoided, and its working life is greatly extended.     The sensor has a built-in voltage regulator chip that supports a 3.3 V/5V working environment, which means it works even on a 3.3 V/5V control board. A miniature PC such as the Raspberry Pi only needs an external ADC (analog to digital signal) conversion module to work.  With an external screen and a motherboard, you can talk to your plants! See if it is thirsty and you don't need more water to moisten.  Operating voltage: 3.3 V/5V  Output voltage: 3.3 V/5V  Interface: PH2.54-3P  Size: 98 x 23mm (LxW)    Package Included:     1 x Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor
