Description:Model: DL13S (3.7V rated Li-ION Battery not for 3.2V Rated LiFePO4)common Version : common port for charge/discharge separate Version : separate port for charge/dischargeWe can customize any PCB from 1S to 30S lithium batteries with different current.(Quantity＞10) Highlight：For the same model, its charge current is less than discharge current.Overview:◆DL13S48V15A/20A/30A/40A/50A/60A bms is used for 13 series 48V battery pack.◆We can design it for various lithium batteries like LiFepo4, LiMn2O4, and Li-polymer etc.◆The main functions are: over charge protection, over discharge protection, over current protection, short-circuit protection, temperature protection etc.◆According to the customer request we can develop PCM in different sizes and structures.◆BMS manufactured by  high quality Mos and IC imported . Keep your battery long cycle serivce life time. Advantage:◆Use top quality (A-level) protective integrated circuit IC◆Strong load ability, constant discharge current 15A/20A/30A/40A/50A/60A , use high voltage resistance, low inner resistance power Mosfet. The heat sink will greatly help cooling.◆IC itself has power balancing function. The circuit is simple and reliable.◆Typical voltage detection for each cell. So each battery will be prevented over charged or over discharged. Over current and short circuit protection function is very reliable.Long time short circuit of the load won’t affect the PCB and the battery.Temperature protection during charging and discharging.◆Extreme low power consumption. The consumption of the whole device is less than 50uA.◆PCB use high anti-corrosion, high water resistance, high impedance ESD conformal Coating.Package Included:1 x DL13S 13S 48V BMS Battery Protection Board
