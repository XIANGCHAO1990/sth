This module can work independently as the smallest system. A new WiFi+Bluetooth dual-mode development board based on ESP32 design, using PCB on-board antenna, with 2 high-performance 32-bit LX6CPU, using 7-level pipeline architecture, main frequency adjustment range 80MHz to 240Mhz. Ultra-low power consumption, deep sleep current is as low as 6mA. It is an ultra-small 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi + BT/BLE SoC module.HK-ESP32-CAM-MB adopts Micro USB interface, convenient and reliable connection method, convenient to apply to various IoT hardware terminal occasions.Parameter:Use low-power dual-core 32-bit CPU, which can be used as an application processor.The main frequency is up to 240MHz, and the computing power is up to 600 DMIPSBuilt-in 520 KB SRAM, external 8MB PSRAMSupport UART/SPI/I2C/PWM/ADC/DAC and other interfacesSupport OV2640 and OV7670 cameras, built-in flashSupport picture WiFI uploadSupport TF cardSupport multiple sleep modes.Embedded Lwip and FreeRTOSSupport STA/AP/STA+AP working modeSupport Smart Config/AirKiss one-click network configurationSupport secondary developmentApplication scenario:Home smart device image transmissionWireless monitoringSmart agricultureQR wireless recognitionWireless positioning system signalAnd other IoT applicationsSpecifications:Working voltage 4.75-5.25VSPIFlash default 32MbitRAM internal 520KB + external 8MB PSRAMWi-Fi 802.11b/g/n/e/iBluetooth Bluetooth 4.2BR/EDR and BLE standardSupport interface (2Mbps) UART, SPI, I2C, PWMSupport TF card, maximum support 4GIO port 9Serial port rate default 115200bpsSpectrum range 2400 ~2483.5MHzAntenna form Onboard PCB antenna, gain 2dBiImage output format: JPEG (only OV2640 support), BMP, GRAYSCALEPackaging method DIP-16Transmit power 802.11b: 17±2dBm (@11Mbps)802.11g: 14±2dBm (@54Mbps)802.11n: 13±2dBm (@MCS7)Receiving sensitivity CCK, 1Mbps: -90dBmCCK, 11Mbps: -85dBm6Mbps(1/2BPSK): -88dBm54Mbps (3/464-QAM): -70dBmMCS7 (65Mbps, 72.2Mbps): -67dBmPower consumption Turn off the flash:180mA@5VTurn on the flash and adjust the brightness to the maximum:310mA@5VDeep-sleep: The lowest power consumption can reach6mA@5VModerm-sleep: the lowest can reach20mA@5VLight-sleep: the lowest can reach6.7mA@5VSecurity WPA/WPA2/WPA2-Enterprise/WPSWorking temperature -20 ℃~ 70 ℃Storage environment -40 ℃~ 125 ℃, <90%RHWeight 10g/pcsPackage includes:3 x ESP32-CAM-MB WIFI3 x ESP32-CAM Development Board3 x 2.4G Antenna IPX3 x OV2640 Camera
