 - Saturn 3D printer comes with an 8.9inch 4K Monochrome LCD with an HD 
resolution of 3840 x 2400, reducing the layer printing time to 1.5s-2s, 
which is 60% faster than Mars Pro yet still delivers outstanding 
printing results.Larger build volume - Saturn has a 
large printing volume of 192*120*200 mm/7.55in*4.72in*7.87in, and you 
can print multiple full-sized models at the same time, which can 
dramatically improve your productivity.

 Higher precision and easier printing - Z-axis utilizes a
 double linear guide way structure, which can achieve steadier motion 
and greatly enhanced moving accuracy. With the Ethernet port on the back
 and 4 GB built-in data disk, Saturn now supports file transfer through 
your local area network, which is very handy for fast printing.

Quality Prints and Consistent Success - Matrix light 
source consists of 54 UV LED lights with uniform light emission, 
ensuring superior print results and a more accurate printing size. The 
set screws on the build plate assure long-lasting leveling, no need for 
frequent calibration, and the sandblasted surface provides a much 
stronger adherence, especially when printing large 3D models.We
 provide a 1-year warranty on the whole printer (4K LCD, FEP film, and 
tool kit excluded). Some File for you to download:* Firmware1.Latest Firmware: Click to download: V4.3.192.Firmware You Need to Update after Replacing The LCD: Click to downloadHow to replace the LCD: https://youtu.be/NJhucYuSjjk3.Machine Parameters: Click to Download*Caution:
