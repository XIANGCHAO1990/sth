Attention:1. Customer need to identify the battery's series, then choose the same series BMS. Such as your battery is 24S, you must choose 24S BMS, can not choose 20 or other one. The number of  series of BMS is  fixed ,not adjustable once the BMS is shipped out .2. All accessories and BMS are the latest version, maybe the picture has not been updated, if you are concerned about the version, please consult the specific situation before purchasing.Description:Model: DL13S (3.7V rated Li-ION Battery not for 3.2V Rated LiFePO4)common Version : common port for charge/discharge separate Version : separate port for charge/dischargeWe can customize any PCB from 1S to 30S lithium batteries with different current. Highlight：For the same model, its charge current is less than discharge current because Daly PCBAs were updated to well protect customer battery. Overview:◆DL13S48V80A 100A 120A 150A 200A 300A 400A 500A PCB is used for 13 series 48V battery pack.◆We can design it for various lithium batteries like LiFepo4, LiMn2O4, and Li-polymer etc.◆The main functions are: over charge protection, over discharge protection, over current protection, short-circuit protection, temperature protection etc.◆According to the customer request we can develop PCM in different sizes and structures.◆BMS manufactured by  high quality Mos and IC imported . Keep your battery long cycle serivce life time. Advantage:◆Strong load ability, constant discharge current 80A 100A 120A 150A 200A 300A 400A 500A, use high voltage resistance, low innerresistance power Mosfet. The heat sink will greatly help cooling.◆IC itself has power balancing function. The circuit is simple and reliable.◆Typical voltage detection for each cell. So each battery will be prevented over charged or over discharged. Over current and short circuit protectionfunction is very reliable.Long time short circuit of the load won’t affect the PCB and the battery.Temperature protection during charging and discharging.◆Extreme low power consumption. The consumption of the whole device is less than 50uA.◆PCB use high anti-corrosion, high water resistance, high impedance ESD conformal Coating.Package Included: (Choose different BMS specifications according to your needs:)BMS Board :1 x BMS Board1 x Cable (Use to connect battery)1 x NTC Module
