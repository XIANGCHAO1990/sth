Feature:

	 

- New item release: The controller allows for trouble-free operation of inverters and AC mains in the same circuit. The controller switches automatically between inverter and AC mains while protecting the inverter against external voltage.

- Works like an UPS, But in opposite direction: The controller will switch to grid when batteried are low to cut off point, once the batteries are back to recovery point, it will switch back to battery power.

- Great for solar and wind: Automatically switches over to grid power on those cloudy or windless days and your batteries get low, Take charge over your battery bank.
