Working Principle:

	 

Multi-angle La0ser Scattering Detection, la0ser irradiation in the suspended particulate matter in the air and generate scattering. Scattered light will be collected in a specified angle at the same time. According to the scattering intensity, time-varying curves can be obtained through the sensor. Being processed by the microcomputer processor, equivalent particle diameters and the number of suspended particulate matter with different sizes in per unit volume can be obtained.

- Suitable for home/office and car or part scope on air quality detection  What are PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0?In addition to gaseous pollution, the surrounding air may also be polluted by particles. These particles (suspension, liquid or solid) with different compositions and sizes are sometimes called "aerosols". They are usually classified as "suspended matter" and are 0ften referred to as PM (abbreviation of "Particulate Matter" in English).The floating fabric is generally classified according to "aerodynamic diameter". The aerodynamic diameter of a dust particle is the diameter of a spherical particle, and the diameter of the spherical particle shows the same behavior as the dust particle in ambient air (not necessarily having a spherical shape). In the context of air quality issues, particulate matter is particularly important.Fine particles such as PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 are defined as parts with aerodynamic diameters of less than 10, 2.5, and 1 µm (information: 1 µm = parts per million) meters or thousandths of a millimeter ). For comparison, the average diameter of human hair is 50-70 µm.What is the difference between PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0?PM1: PM1 is much finer than PM2.5. The main source of PM1 is mainly daily power generation, industrial production, indoor environmental pollution, etc., which is difficult to judge by the naked eye. PM1 mainly comes from the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and VOCs.PM2.5: PM2.5 has a small particle size, large area, and strong activity. It is easy to attach toxic and hazardous substances (for example, heavy metals, microorganisms, etc.), and it has a long residence time in the atmosphere and a long transportation distance. Human health and atmospheric environmental quality have a greater impact. PM2.5 is mainly smog and dust from roads in daily life.PM10: PM10, also known as respirable particulate matter, refers to particulate matter with an aerodynamic equivalent diameter of ≤10 microns. Usually comes from motor vehicles driving on unpaved asphalt and cement roads, crushing and grinding of materials, and dust raised by the wind.
