>>>Manual: Click here to open<<<Note:This product is a step-down module and cannot be boosted! The input voltage is 55V, and the output voltage can be adjusted from 0-50V. If the output voltage is 12V, the minimum input voltage should be 14V. The input voltage should not exceed 55V, it must be DC and not AC.Highlights:1. The LCD can display input/output voltage, output current/output power/output capacity/output time;2. Numerical control adjustment, precise and fast, step-down output, arbitrary adjustment of output voltage 0-50.00V, arbitrary adjustment of limited current 0-20.00A;3. The output terminal will not burn when it is poured backwards;4. The module can be set to be turned on/off by default;5. Has a variety of software protection mechanisms, and the protection threshold is adjustable. When the working parameters of the module exceed the protection threshold, the output will be automatically turned off;6. Using synchronous rectification technology, high conversion efficiency: more than 90% efficiency;7. Increase the heat sink and install a fan to enhance heat dissipation.Feature:Model: WZ5020LDisplay: LCDInput voltage range: 6-55.00VInput voltage resolution: 0.01VOutput voltage range: 0-50.00VOutput voltage resolution: 0.01VOutput current range: 0-20.00AOutput current resolution: 0.01AOutput power range: 0-1000WInput voltage accuracy: ±(1%+5)Output voltage accuracy: ±(0.3%+5)Output current accuracy: ±(0.5%+5)Typical value of output ripple: 150mV Peak valueNormal operating temperature range: -10℃~40℃Capacity measurement range: 0-999.9AHStatistical error of capacity energy: ±2%Statistical time range: 0-100hourDepressurization mode: differential pressure >0.05%+1VProduct size:  panel 79X43X42mmProduct size:  Main board 106x76x40mmSoft start: YesProtection mechanism:Input undervoltage protection (5.8-50v adjustable, default 5.8v)Output overvoltage protection (0-51.00v adjustable, default 51V)Output over-current protection (0-20.10a adjustable, default 20.10a)Timeout protection (0 - 100h adjustable, off by default)Over capacity protection (0 – 999.9ah adjustable, off by default)Package includes:1 x DIY Desktop CNC Power Supply
