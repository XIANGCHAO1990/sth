①Ripple and noise measurement method: Use a 12mm twisted pair cable, and the terminal should be connected with 0.1uF and 47uF capacitors in parallel and measure at 20MHz bandwidth.

②Efficiency is tested at an input voltage of 230VAC, rated load, and ambient temperature of 25°C.

Accuracy: Includes setting error, linear adjustment rate and load adjustment rate.

Linear Rate Test Method: Test from low voltage to high voltage at rated load.

Load regulation test method: from 0% to 100% of rated load.

The startup time is measured in the cold start state. The fast and frequent switching machine may increase the startup time. When the operating altitude is higher than 2000M, the operating environment temperature should be reduced by 5°C/1000M.

Package includes:

		1 x Power Supply

		 

Note: Due to logistics reasons, the following problems may occur after you receive the goods (just like the picture), you can use your hand to adjust, that's ok, if you mind this, please stop buying.
