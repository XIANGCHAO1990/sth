Feature:Retroscaler2x can accept 240p/480i/288p/576i ntsc/pal signal source to 480p/576p HDMI compatible output (480p to ntsc, 576p to pal) converter. For example, 240p signals are correctly supported, allowing fully progressive linedouble at 480p. The 480i signal is deinterlaced and dubbed equally at 480p. Keep in mind that the output resolution of this device is only 480p/576p at the highestZero Latency: Retroscaler2x is a zero-delay device that has been verified by many different measurements and devices.Compatible area: Both ntsc and pal signals are supported, but they will not be converted to each other. This means that you can connect to any signal compatible with the target device, but ntsc may not work on HDMI pal compatible devices, and vice versaFilter mode: The fil mode is completely based on preference, but general retro gamers prefer to turn off the fil mode for 2d games (snes, genesis, etc.) and 3d games (n64, saturn, etc.). In addition, fil mode can help reduce flicker in some 480i-only gamesCompatibility: Another important feature of retroscaler2x is that it generates a real 480p60 signal, making it compatible with all the devices I have tested! Compatibility is a big issue for retro gamers, because modern screens are not used for the resolution or refresh rate of these old game consoles. This device is an excellent help for anchors who want greatest chance of compatibilityAudio performance: The audio performance on retroscaler2x is good, although we have to stop saying it is perfect. In general use, there is no problem with audio digitization, but it sounds like an explosion on the bra, and the output may sound rougher than through ossc. This is not something you might notice on your TV speakers, although you might notice if you have an external amplifier or home theater system. In this case, of course, in any case, it is usually very easy to locate the audio around the retroscaler2xTransit: By placing the retroscaler2x in pass-through mode, composite, s-video or component input signals are simply transparent and digitized to HDMI compatible. In the HDMI compatible world, support for 240p is rare, but by adding a simple HDMI compatible to VGA converter, you can convert the signal back to the analog domain again. This makes the unit a perfect transcoder that can be used with 15khz exposures such as pvms or osscCompatible with the following hosts: Vic20/Atari2600/Msx/NES/N64/NGC/SFC/SNES/SuperFamicom/PIAYSATION2/SEGA Saturn/MD2/MD1/Dreamcast/Commodore64 (C64)Product box size: 22.5x21.5x5.5cmProduct box weight: 480gConnecting your RetroScaler2x:Connect a suitable source to the composite, component (YPBPR) or S-video connectors.(The inputs can only be used one at a time and it’s strongly suggested that you do not leave consoles plugged in at the same time, even if they are off)Ensure you are connected to the USB power, and then switch on your RetroScaler2XConnect to the display via HDMI-compatible interface, and then play your gamesSelect the appropriate video mode through button according to your needsButtons, connectors and external controls:Component video input: Connect component video (YPBPR) or RGB with sync on green sources to this input. As a note, the chip used in this device does not support RGB, so an RGB SCART input will never be an optionS-video input: Connect an S-video (4 pins connector) source to this input, other sources are not supportAV input: Standard composite (RCA) connector. You can connect sources such as for Nintendo Super Famicom, for Nintendo for GameCube, N64 etc.HDMI-compatible video out: All the received video and audio signals will be output on the modern LCD monitor/TVs with HDMI-compatible interfacePower input: Any decent quality Micro USB charger can be used to power the RetroScaler2x, as it’s a very efficient device. Your are even able to power mine via the USB ports of your TVPower Switch: Toggles power off and onInput Select (INPUT SELECT): The input button selects between the composite, S-Video and Component Video inputs, or combinationOutput Select (SMOOTHING): The smoothing mode button allows you to chose which video mode it's in2x Mode (orange led light on ): This is the standard "LINEDOUBLE" mode that outputs 480p/576p. This is the mode that’s the system defaults to when powered onFIL (blue led lights on): This mode adds a filtering option to to minimize image aliasing for the 480p/576p outputPass-through (both orange and blue LEDs light off):This mode simply output whatever the input signal is, without changing the resolutionRetroTINK2X and OSSC:You can simply use the two devices in tandem, support both composite video and s-video and advanced features of ossc. Piggybacking the RetroScaler2x to the OSSC is very easy .All you need is a simple HDMI-compatible to VGA adapter. We will be carrying a tried and tested model in our store that fully supports 240p output and does not appear to crush blacks or over-saturate whites. With a suitable adapter in hand, set the RetroScaler2X to transcode mode, connect the HDMI-compatible to VGA adapter to your RetroScaler2X, then connect the output of the adapter into your OSSC via the VGA port. Finally, switch the VGA port on the OSSC to 480p mode (Sampling opt->480p in sampler->DTV 480p).you have access to the OSSCs famous scanline engine and line multiplication modes with all your composite video and S-Video sources. You can also access things like the advanced timing tweaker, allowing you to center the image using the backporch controls or apply a little faux zoom using the V.Active controlsNote:RetroScaler2X does not support all PAL-MConsoles in BrazilPlease observe the following safety precautions when using your Retro Scaler2xUse the correct power supply: the Retroscaler2x is powered by a regular 5 volt Micro USB port that can be powered by a normal power supply or powered by a device that has a USB port. Please make sure that the power supply you are using meets any of the above requirements. Never use a power supply that is not regulated to prevent damage to the equipmentTurn off the power before connecting/disconnecting the device: to prevent damage to the device for ICs, always turn off the power before connecting the monitor or deviceDo not expose to moisture Droplets of moisture: may contact the PCB and cause a short circuit.
