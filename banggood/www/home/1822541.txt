Please make sure the wall is clean before pasting. If the wall is rough or dirty, it is recommended to use glass glue as the adhesive.2. When sticking, it must be pressed tightly so that the adhesive can better contact with the wall and prevent it from falling off in the future.3. Larger wall stickers, because of the larger format, we will disconnect them for the convenience of packaging and transportation. You should try to attach them as closely as possible during installation. It is best to work with multiple people.Maintenance:1.
